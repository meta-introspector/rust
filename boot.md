# Boot Sequence - To-Do List

## Current State:
*   Top-level `Cargo.toml` is currently blank.
*   `cargo_manager` Rust project exists, intended to regenerate `Cargo.toml`.
*   `submodule_analyzer` Rust project exists, intended to generate `cargo tree` outputs.
*   New lattice submodules (`lattirust`, `latticefold-rs`, `Lazarus`, `qfall-crypto`) are added.
*   Formal methods submodules (`mathlib4`, `groupoid_model_in_lean4`, `Coq-HoTT`, `HoTT-Agda`, `HoTTEST-Summer-School`, `hottbox`, `HoTT-Intro`, `hott3`, `ground_zero`, `HoTT-Model`, `HoTT-StudyGroup`, `hott-book-in-lean`, `HoTT-Case-Study`, `cHoTT4`, `HoTT_Lean4`, `UniMath`, `SymmetryBook`) are added.
*   Previous attempts to build `cargo_manager` failed due to `Cargo.toml` parsing/serialization issues.

## To-Do List (Next Steps):

## To-Do List (Next Steps):

1.  **Create Introspector Documents for Formal Methods Submodules**:
    *   **Action**: Create introspector documents for all formal methods submodules in `vendor/formal_methods/`.
    *   **Reason**: Document the purpose and key features of each formal methods project.
2.  **Define Initial "Vibes" Framework**:
    *   **Action**: Create `docs/vibe_topology_framework.md` to outline the conceptual mapping of "memes," "prime numbers," and "emojis" to mathematical structures, as discussed.
    *   **Reason**: This directly addresses the user's core vision and provides a foundation for future formalization.

## Reboot Protocol:
*   Review `boot.md`
*   Execute tasks sequentially.
*   Reflect after each major step.
*   Maintain chill.
