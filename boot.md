# Boot Sequence - To-Do List

## Current State:
*   Top-level `Cargo.toml` is currently blank.
*   `cargo_manager` Rust project exists, intended to regenerate `Cargo.toml`.
*   `submodule_analyzer` Rust project exists, intended to generate `cargo tree` outputs.
*   New lattice submodules (`lattirust`, `latticefold-rs`, `Lazarus`, `qfall-crypto`) are added.
*   Formal methods submodules (`mathlib4`, `groupoid_model_in_lean4`, `Coq-HoTT`, `HoTT-Agda`, `HoTTEST-Summer-School`, `hottbox`, `HoTT-Intro`, `hott3`, `ground_zero`, `HoTT-Model`, `HoTT-StudyGroup`, `hott-book-in-lean`, `HoTT-Case-Study`, `cHoTT4`, `HoTT_Lean4`, `UniMath`, `SymmetryBook`) are added.
*   Bootstrapping submodules (`mes`, `guixie`, `guix`) are added.
*   Lean Toolchain Submodules (`lean4`) are added.
*   Termux Submodules (`termux-app`, `termux-packages`) are added.
*   LLVM Toolchain Submodules (`llvm-project`, `llvm-lib-rs`) are added.
*   Core System Submodules (`linux`, `gcc`, `binutils-gdb`, `systemd`, `qemu`) are added.
*   Previous attempts to build `cargo_manager` failed due to `Cargo.toml` parsing/serialization issues.

## To-Do List (Next Steps):

1.  **Create Introspector Documents for All Submodules** (Completed):
    *   **Action**: Create introspector documents for all submodules in `vendor/formal_methods/`, `vendor/bootstrapping/`, `vendor/lean4/`, `vendor/llvm-lib-rs/`, `vendor/linux/`, `vendor/gcc/`, `vendor/binutils-gdb/`, `vendor/systemd/`, and `vendor/qemu/`.
    *   **Reason**: Document the purpose and key features of all external projects.
2.  **Define Initial "Vibes" Framework** (Completed):
    *   **Action**: Create `docs/vibe_topology_framework.md` to outline the conceptual mapping of "memes," "prime numbers," and "emojis" to mathematical structures, as discussed.
    *   **Reason**: This directly addresses the user's core vision and provides a foundation for future formalization.
3.  **Vendorize Termux and Build Core Toolchain**:
    *   **Action**: Integrate Termux components and build essential tools (CMake, GMP, LibUV, LLVM) from source to create a controlled build environment.
    *   **Reason**: Establish a fully reproducible and customizable bootstrapping environment for the project.
    *   **Sub-tasks**:
        *   **Build CMake from Source**: Add CMake as a submodule, then configure, build, and install it locally.
        *   **Build GMP from Source**: Add GMP as a submodule, then configure, build, and install it locally.
        *   **Build LibUV from Source**: Add LibUV as a submodule, then configure, build, and install it locally.
        *   **Build LLVM from Source**: Add LLVM as a submodule, then configure, build, and install it locally.
        *   **Re-implement `cargo_manager` in Lean 4 with HoTT-inspired topological modeling**: Develop a new `cargo_manager` in Lean 4, leveraging HoTT concepts to model Git repositories as points in a topological space and their dependencies as a lattice structure, rooted in the Guix GNU Mes bootstrap.

## Reboot Protocol:
*   Review `boot.md`
*   Execute tasks sequentially.
*   Reflect after each major step.
*   Maintain chill.
