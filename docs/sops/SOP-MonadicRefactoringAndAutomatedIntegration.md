SOP: Monadic Refactoring and Automated Integration for Rust Bootstrap

## Objective
To systematically refactor the `rust-bootstrap` codebase into highly modular, functionally composed units, and to automate their integration using a monadic pattern for controlled, step-by-step execution and verification. This SOP aims to facilitate the seamless integration of external functionalities (like Cargo and `rustc` components) as "virtual executions" within the bootstrap process.

## Principles
*   **Extreme Modularity**: Adhere to "one declaration per file" for all functions, structs, enums, and constants.
*   **Functional Composition**: Design functions to be pure, immutable where possible, and easily composable.
*   **Monadic Integration**: Wrap external crate functionalities (e.g., `cargo::ops::compile`) and native functions within a monadic structure (e.g., a `Result` or custom `Monad` trait) to ensure controlled execution flow, error propagation, and state management. Each step in the bootstrap process should be a monadic operation.
*   **Automated Generation**: Leverage build scripts (`build.rs`) to automatically generate boilerplate code (e.g., module declarations, provider lists) to reduce manual effort and ensure consistency.
*   **Virtual Execution**: Treat the execution of integrated functions as "virtual" steps within the bootstrap, allowing for fine-grained control, logging, and potential simulation/testing.

## Scope
This SOP applies to all new and existing code within the `rust-bootstrap` crate, particularly focusing on the integration of `cargo` and `rustc` functionalities.

## Prerequisites
*   Familiarity with Rust's module system, traits, and error handling.
*   Understanding of functional programming concepts, especially monads (e.g., `Result`, `Option`, or custom monads).
*   Proficiency with `build.rs` scripts for code generation.
*   Access to the `libminizinc` wrapper for potential formal verification of monadic properties.

## Procedure

### 4.1. Identify Monadic Operations:
    a. **Analyze Workflow**: Break down the `rust-bootstrap` process (e.g., argument parsing, config loading, build stages, command execution) into discrete, sequential operations.
    b. **Define Monadic Type**: Determine the appropriate monadic type for the bootstrap process (e.g., `Result<T, E>` for error handling, or a custom `BootstrapResult` monad for richer state).
    c. **Encapsulate Side Effects**: Identify functions with side effects (e.g., file I/O, external command execution) and plan how to wrap them within the chosen monadic type.

### 4.2. Refactor Functions into Monadic Units:
    a. **"One Declaration Per File"**: Ensure each function is in its own file.
    b. **Monadic Signature**: Modify function signatures to return the chosen monadic type (e.g., `fn foo(...) -> Result<T, E>`).
    c. **Error Propagation**: Use `?` operator or explicit `match` statements to propagate errors through the monadic chain.
    d. **Pure Functions**: Strive to make functions pure (no side effects) where possible, with side effects encapsulated at the monadic boundaries.

### 4.3. Automate Module and Provider Generation (`build.rs`):
    a. **Argument/Subcommand Providers**: Continue to use `build.rs` to generate lists of `ArgumentProvider` and `SubcommandProvider` implementations.
    b. **Monadic Function Registry**: Extend `build.rs` to generate a registry of monadic functions, allowing for dynamic dispatch and composition.
    c. **`mod.rs` Generation**: Automate the generation of `pub mod` declarations in `mod.rs` files by scanning directories, ensuring consistency with the "one declaration per file" principle.

### 4.4. Compose Monadic Operations:
    a. **Chaining**: Use monadic chaining (e.g., `and_then`, `map`, `filter`) to compose individual monadic functions into larger, sequential workflows.
    b. **Virtual Execution**: Design the composition such that each step can be conceptually viewed as a "virtual execution," allowing for logging, tracing, and potential simulation/testing.

### 4.5. Verification and Formal Methods:
    a. **Unit/Property Testing**: Use `quickcheck` for property-based testing of individual monadic units.
    b. **MiniZinc Verification**: For critical properties or complex state transitions, model them in MiniZinc and use `libminizinc` to formally verify correctness. This can include:
        *   **Pre/Post Conditions**: Model function pre-conditions and post-conditions as MiniZinc constraints.
        *   **State Invariants**: Verify that state invariants are maintained across monadic operations.
        *   **Test Case Generation**: Use MiniZinc to generate complex, valid (or invalid) inputs for monadic functions.
    c. **Integration Testing**: Verify the end-to-end monadic workflow.

## Tools Used
*   `cargo` (for build, test)
*   `build.rs` (for code generation)
*   `clap` (for argument parsing)
*   `tracing` (for logging and debugging)
*   `quickcheck` (for property-based testing)
*   `libminizinc` (for MiniZinc integration and formal verification)
*   `write_file`, `read_file`, `replace` (for file manipulation, used judiciously as per SOP)

## Best Practices & Considerations
*   **Granularity**: Maintain extreme modularity, even within monadic units.
*   **Error Handling**: Standardize error types and ensure consistent error propagation.
*   **Performance**: Monitor performance impact of monadic wrapping and JIT execution.
*   **Complexity Management**: The monadic approach can introduce its own complexity; ensure clarity and good documentation.
*   **Iterative Development**: Apply this SOP iteratively, refactoring small parts of the codebase at a time.
