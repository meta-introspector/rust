# SOP-SIM-001: Batch Crate Integration

## Purpose
To efficiently integrate multiple new crates into the `rustc` workspace, leveraging the validated integration method.

## Procedure
1.  Identify remaining "new work" and "bootstrap" crates from the initial `Cargo.toml` list (or `glob` output).
2.  Prioritize crates for integration based on their "age" (stability, maturity) and "topological space" (dependencies).
3.  Apply the integration method validated in SOP-NCI-002 to batches of these crates.
4.  For each batch, execute the `rustc` build process and analyze compilation output.
5.  Address any new compilation errors by debugging and applying necessary fixes (code modifications, dependency adjustments, build script patches), documenting all changes.
6.  Iterate until all selected crates are successfully integrated and compile within the `rustc` workspace.

## Tools
*   `read_file`, `write_file`, `replace`, `run_shell_command`.
*   Rust compiler and associated tools.
*   Version control system (`git`) for managing changes and branches.

## Output
*   A comprehensive log of all integrated crates, their batching, and compilation status.
*   Documentation of any new issues encountered and their resolutions.

## Verification
*   Successful compilation of all integrated crates within the `rustc` workspace.
*   Regular code reviews and automated tests (if applicable) to ensure stability.
