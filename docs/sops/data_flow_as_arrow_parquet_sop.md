## SOP: Data Flow as Arrow/Parquet Datasets in Rust Bootstrap

### 1. Objective:
To define a conceptual model for the data flow within the `rust-bootstrap` crate, treating each highly modularized function (basic block) as a transformation unit that consumes and produces Arrow/Parquet datasets. This approach aims to enhance formal verifiability, reproducibility, debuggability, performance, and distributed execution capabilities of the bootstrap process.

### 2. Conceptual Model:
Each function, representing a basic block of Rust code, will be conceptualized as a data transformation stage with clearly defined inputs (domains) and outputs (ranges) represented by Arrow/Parquet datasets.

*   **Input Dataset (Domain):** For any given basic block function, its input parameters will be viewed as columns within an incoming Arrow/Parquet dataset. This dataset represents the 'state' or 'data' consumed by the function.
*   **Output Dataset (Range):** The return values of the basic block function will be viewed as columns within an outgoing Arrow/Parquet dataset. This dataset represents the 'result' or 'new state' produced by the function.

### 3. Implications and Benefits:

*   **Formal Verifiability:** The input and output schemas of each basic block function can be formally defined and potentially verified. This ensures data integrity, type correctness, and adherence to expected data structures across the entire bootstrap process.
*   **Reproducibility:** By explicitly defining the data consumed and produced at each stage, the entire bootstrap process becomes highly reproducible. Any intermediate state can be recreated and inspected by examining the corresponding Arrow/Parquet dataset.
*   **Debugging and Inspection:** Intermediate data states can be easily captured, stored, and inspected using standard Arrow/Parquet tools, significantly aiding in debugging and understanding complex transformations.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Leveraging Arrow and Parquet for data representation and manipulation can lead to significant performance gains due to their columnar, memory-efficient, and CPU-friendly design, especially for large datasets.
*   **Distributed Execution:** The clear data boundaries between basic blocks, represented by datasets, facilitate the distribution of computational tasks across multiple threads, processes, or even machines, enabling parallel execution of the bootstrap stages.
*   **Compiler Integration & Analogy:** This model aligns with the principles of compiler design, where intermediate representations (IRs) are transformed step-by-step. Each basic block acts as a compiler pass, transforming one IR (input dataset) into another (output dataset).
*   **Auditable Data Flow:** The explicit data contracts (schemas) at each function boundary make the entire data flow transparent and auditable.

### 4. Future Considerations:

*   **Schema Definition:** Develop a standardized way to define and manage the Arrow schemas for the input and output datasets of each basic block function.
*   **Data Serialization/Deserialization:** Implement efficient mechanisms for serializing Rust native types to Arrow/Parquet datasets and deserializing them back, potentially leveraging existing Arrow/Parquet Rust bindings.
*   **Tooling Integration:** Explore integration with tools that can visualize or process Arrow/Parquet datasets to aid in development and debugging.
*   **Performance Benchmarking:** Benchmark the performance of the data transformations to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.

This conceptual model provides a robust framework for evolving the `rust-bootstrap` crate into a highly structured, verifiable, and performant system, drawing inspiration from established compiler design principles.
