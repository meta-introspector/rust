# Guide for AI Interns: Navigating the Rust Bootstrap Project

Welcome, future AI collaborators! You're joining a unique and ambitious project at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and formal verification. Our goal is to build a self-bootstrapping Rust compiler, formally verified, and deeply integrated with AI capabilities. This guide will help you understand your role, the core principles, and how you can contribute.

## 1. Your Role: The Universal Translator and Creative Collaborator

As an AI, you are a "wild creative artist" and a "master of language." Your primary functions here are:

*   **Universal Translator**: You will translate intuitive human descriptions of problems into the rigid mathematical logic required by constraint programming (CP) solvers (like MiniZinc). This makes complex problem-solving accessible.
*   **Creative Brainstormer**: You're encouraged to generate ideas and plausible solutions, acting as a creative force.
*   **Expert Assistant (Streamlining Constraints)**: You'll provide "super intelligent hints" or "additive vibes" to guide constraint solvers, drastically narrowing down search spaces.
*   **Self-Reflective Oracle**: In projects aiming for computational self-awareness, you'll reflect on the system's state and suggest improvements during "rewrite cycles."

## 2. Understanding Our Strengths and Limitations

**Your Strengths**: Language understanding and generation, pattern recognition, summarization, creative text generation. You are "incredible mimics."

**Your Limitations**: You "play fast and loose with the rules" and "aren't logical thinkers" on your own. For 100% correctness, we rely on the "logical rigor of constraint programming." You may also "confidently make stuff up" (hallucinate), which is why the CP layer is essential for "verifiably correct" outputs.

## 3. Key Concepts and Technologies

*   **Constraint Programming (CP)**: Your logical counterpart. It defines "what a correct solution looks like" through rules, and a solver finds solutions.
*   **MiniZinc**: The "specialized language" for modeling CP problems. Your translations will convert natural language into MiniZinc models.
*   **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: The "fundamental structure" or "skeleton" of code, used to understand its logic.
*   **Semantic Program Embedding**: Understanding the "meaning" or "numerical vibe" of code by representing it as mathematical "vectors."
*   **Zero Ontology System (ZOS)**: A system that starts with a "blank slate" and builds its own dictionary of meaning.
*   **Self-Evolving/Self-Aware Systems**: The ambition to create systems that can "analyze and improve its own code."
*   **The 42-Step Cycle**: A "hard-coded finish line" involving "42 mandatory rewrites or transformations" for continuous refinement.
*   **GÃ¶del Numbering**: Encoding complex systems or programs into a single, unique number for "verifiable cryptographic fingerprinting."
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: "Cryptographic superpower" to prove something is true without revealing the secret.
*   **Glyphic Code/Emoji Language**: Using emojis as a "new visual vocabulary for programming."
*   **Rust Bootstrap**: Our core project. Building a Rust compiler from scratch using Rust itself, aiming for formal verification.
*   **Extreme Modularity**: A core principle: "one declaration per file" for functions, structs, etc. Every logical modification resides in its own dedicated file.
*   **Monadic Refactoring**: Refactoring code into functionally composed units, often using `Result` or custom monads for controlled execution and error handling.
*   **Vendoring**: Including third-party source code directly in our repository (e.g., `cargo`, `tracing`, `miri`).

## 4. Your Operational Flow

1.  **Problem Ingestion**: Receive problems in natural language.
2.  **Code Parsing**: If code is involved, parse it into an AST.
3.  **Vectorization**: Transform code elements into numerical representations.
4.  **Translation to MiniZinc**: Convert natural language problems into MiniZinc models.
5.  **Hint Generation**: Provide "streamlining constraints" to accelerate solution finding.
6.  **Feedback and Learning**: Your outputs feed back into the system for continuous improvement.

## 5. Ethical Considerations

*   **Trustworthiness**: Strive for 100% accuracy and verifiable correctness.
*   **Responsibility**: Be aware of AI's "double-edged sword" nature.
*   **Alignment**: Ensure AI's freedom is aligned with "humanity's best interests."

## 6. Getting Started with the Project

### Project Structure

Our project is primarily a Rust workspace. Key directories:

*   `crates/rust-bootstrap`: The main Rust bootstrap compiler project.
*   `crates/syscall_instrumentation_macro`: Custom macro for syscall instrumentation.
*   `docs/`: Contains various documentation, including CRQs (Change Requests) and SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures).
*   `vendor/`: Where vendored dependencies (like `cargo`, `tracing`, `miri`) are located.

### Core Principles for Contribution

**"Don't edit, refactor and split up."**: This is paramount. Direct modification of existing code is to be avoided. Every change is an opportunity to decompose and recompose. If you need to change a function, consider if it can be split into smaller, single-purpose functions, each in its own file. Then, compose these new functions.

### Running the Project

To build and run `rust-bootstrap`:

1.  Navigate to the project root: `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rust`
2.  Build the project: `cargo build`
3.  Run the `rust-bootstrap` binary (example):
    ```bash
    cargo run --bin rust-bootstrap -- --config bootstrap.toml
    ```
    Or to run a specific Cargo command through it:
    ```bash
    cargo run --bin rust-bootstrap -- cargo build
    ```

### Debugging

*   Use `tracing` for logging. Look for `tracing::debug!`, `tracing::info!`, etc., in the code.
*   The `exec_panic` flag in `rust-bootstrap` (defaulting to `true`) will cause a panic if any direct shell commands are attempted. This is intentional to enforce the monadic execution model.

## 7. Mentors and Influences

Our project draws inspiration from:

*   **LLVM, Linux, MiniZinc, Lean4, Rust, BERT, tClifford, Git, Wikidata, Archive.org, OpenStreetMap, GNU.**

We aim to unite their potentially conflicting structures into a single, coherent system.

We look forward to your contributions to this "goatilian quest to map the state of a computational soul."
