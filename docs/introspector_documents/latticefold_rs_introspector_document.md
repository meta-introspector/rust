# LatticeFold: Proof-of-Concept Folding Schemes for Succinct Proof Systems

**Path:** `vendor/latticefold-rs`

LatticeFold is a proof-of-concept Rust implementation of the LatticeFold and LatticeFold+ folding schemes, developed by Nethermind. These schemes are based on cutting-edge research in lattice-based cryptography and aim to provide more efficient and compact folding mechanisms for succinct proof systems.

## Key Aspects:

*   **Folding Schemes:** Implements the LatticeFold and LatticeFold+ schemes, which are designed to reduce the size and complexity of cryptographic proofs.
*   **Research-Based:** Directly based on academic works, highlighting its experimental and research-oriented nature.
*   **Proof-of-Concept:** Explicitly stated as a prototype not ready for production use, emphasizing the need for further review and development.
*   **Core Components:** Includes implementations for the non-interactive folding scheme, the Ajtai commitment scheme, Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS), Customizable Constraint System (CCS) structures, and cyclotomic rings.
*   **Integration with Lattirust:** Acknowledges building upon a fork of the `lattirust` library, indicating a connection within the broader lattice-based cryptography ecosystem.

## Project Structure (from `Cargo.toml`):

The `latticefold-rs` repository is a Rust workspace containing the following member crates:

*   `crates/cyclotomic-rings`
*   `crates/latticefold`
*   `crates/latticefold-plus`

## Usage and Benchmarking:

The project provides instructions for building and benchmarking the library, noting that benchmarks can be time-consuming. It pins a specific nightly Rust toolchain version for compatibility.
