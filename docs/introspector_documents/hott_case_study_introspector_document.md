# HoTT-Case-Study Introspector Document

## Overview

`HoTT-Case-Study` is a research project focused on the formalization of advanced mathematical concepts, specifically algebraic schemes and Nagata's Conjecture on plane algebraic curves, within the framework of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT). It explores the use of topoi as models for first-order languages and has transitioned its formalization efforts across different versions of the Lean theorem prover.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **Formalization of Advanced Mathematics**: Aims to formalize complex topics in algebraic geometry using HoTT.
*   **Topoi as Models**: Investigates the application of topoi as models for first-order languages within the formalization process.
*   **Evolution Across Lean Versions**: The project has a history of development in Lean 2 (using the original HoTT library) and Lean 3 (leveraging `hott3`), with future plans to migrate to Lean 4.
*   **Exploration of Cubical Type Theory**: Considers the integration of Cubical Type Theory to achieve computable univalence and Higher Inductive Types (HITs).

## Usage

This repository is primarily for researchers and formal methods practitioners interested in the intersection of algebraic geometry, Homotopy Type Theory, and theorem proving. It provides insights into the challenges and approaches to formalizing highly abstract mathematical theories.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The repository contains Lean source files (`.lean`) and a detailed `README.md` that outlines the project's motivation, mathematical background, and formalization journey. It also includes a `Lean2-HoTT` folder for historical Lean 2 files.

## Mentors and Influences

`HoTT-Case-Study` is influenced by foundational work in Homotopy Type Theory, algebraic geometry, and the development of theorem provers like Lean. It represents a significant effort in pushing the boundaries of formalized mathematics.
