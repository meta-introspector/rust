# llvm-lib-rs Introspector Document

## Overview

`llvm-lib-rs` is a Rust library designed to provide a safe and flexible interface to the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure. It leverages the `LLVM-C` API (via the `llvm-sys` Rust crate) to offer Rust developers a robust tool for interacting with LLVM functionalities, particularly for building compiler backends.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **Safe LLVM Interface**: Provides Rust-idiomatic bindings to LLVM, ensuring memory safety and type safety when interacting with the underlying C API.
*   **Flexibility**: Offers a comprehensive set of APIs covering various LLVM capabilities, including module management, inline assembly, and debugging metadata.
*   **Extensibility**: Designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy extension to support new LLVM features as they evolve.
*   **Compiler Backend Development**: Primarily aimed at developers who need to create compiler backends in Rust, enabling them to harness LLVM's optimization and code generation capabilities.
*   **Based on `LLVM-C` API**: Built on the stable `LLVM-C` API, providing a reliable foundation for interaction.

## Usage

Developers can integrate `llvm-lib-rs` into their Rust projects to build compilers, language toolchains, or other applications that require low-level interaction with LLVM. It simplifies the process of working with LLVM from Rust by providing a safer abstraction layer.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The repository contains Rust source code that wraps LLVM types and implements corresponding functions. The `README.md` provides an overview of its design principles, safety considerations, and current development status.

## Mentors and Influences

`llvm-lib-rs` is influenced by the design of LLVM itself and the Rust programming language's emphasis on safety and performance. It contributes to the growing ecosystem of Rust-based tools for compiler development.
