# Guixie Introspector Document

## Overview

`guixie` is a conceptual project centered around a Guile-based bootstrap for an introspective and self-modifying system. The core idea is to create a system that can generate new versions of itself through Guix derivations, functioning as a self-modifying Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Each iteration of `guixie` composes itself and builds the next version in a continuous chain of evolution.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **Self-Modifying System**: `guixie` is designed to evolve autonomously, with each running instance capable of creating new, improved versions of itself.
*   **Guix Derivations**: Leverages GNU Guix's declarative package management and build system to define and generate these self-modifying iterations.
*   **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Metaphor**: Each instance acts as a self-modifying DAO, implying a distributed and autonomous development process.
*   **P2P Network for Validation**: Future plans include a peer-to-peer network for validating results using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of generated binaries.
*   **Reusable Binary Results**: Aims to enable the sharing and reuse of validated binary results across the network.

## Usage

`guixie` is currently a conceptual framework for a highly autonomous and verifiable software development and distribution system. Its practical usage would involve running instances that generate and validate new versions, contributing to a decentralized software ecosystem.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The repository contains a `README.md` that outlines the project's ambitious vision and core ideas. The implementation details would involve Guile scripts and Guix package definitions to achieve the self-modifying and bootstrapping capabilities.

## Mentors and Influences

`guixie` is heavily influenced by the principles of bootstrappable builds, functional package management (GNU Guix), and decentralized systems (DAO, P2P networks, ZKPs). It represents a forward-thinking approach to software development and verification.
