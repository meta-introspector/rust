# HoTT-Intro Introspector Document

## Overview

`HoTT-Intro` is a repository that provides materials for a first introduction course to Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT). It includes lecture notes and accompanying formalization projects in various proof assistants, such as Agda and Coq, closely following the course material. The project aims to serve as an accessible entry point for students from mathematics, philosophy, and computer science backgrounds.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **Introductory Course Material**: Offers comprehensive lecture notes covering fundamental HoTT concepts, from dependent type theory to synthetic homotopy theory.
*   **Formalization Projects**: Contains formalizations of course material in proof assistants like Agda and Coq, along with solutions to exercises, providing practical experience.
*   **Extensive Documentation**: The course notes serve as detailed documentation for the formalization projects, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and their formal counterparts.
*   **Target Audience**: Designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, making complex topics approachable.

## Usage

Users can access the lecture notes and formalization projects for self-study or as part of a structured course. The notes can be compiled using `latexmk`.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The repository includes `Agda/` and `Coq/` directories for formalization projects, a `pdfs/` folder for older course notes, and the main `hott-intro.tex` file for the book's source. The `README.md` provides an overview and links to course details.

## Mentors and Influences

The project is led by Egbert Rijke and reflects the pedagogical approaches to teaching Homotopy Type Theory, emphasizing both theoretical understanding and practical formalization skills.
