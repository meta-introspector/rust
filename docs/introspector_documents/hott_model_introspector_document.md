# HoTT-Model Introspector Document

## Overview

`HoTT-Model` is a Lean project focused on formalizing the simplicial model of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT). It systematically develops the semantic foundations of HoTT, including contextual categories and universes, and then applies these concepts to construct and analyze the simplicial model. The project also explores properties like locally cartesian closedness and aims to formalize a pure type system.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **Simplicial Model Formalization**: Aims to provide a complete formalization of the simplicial model of HoTT, following a specific academic paper.
*   **Contextual Categories and Universes**: Develops the theoretical underpinnings of HoTT semantics, including the formalization of contextual categories and universes.
*   **Higher Inductive Types (HITs)**: Implies the construction and properties of HITs within the simplicial model context.
*   **Locally Cartesian Closed Categories**: Investigates and formalizes properties related to locally cartesian closed categories, which are crucial for type theory semantics.
*   **Syntactic Formalization**: Includes efforts to formalize a pure type system, laying the groundwork for connecting syntax and semantics.

## Usage

This repository is a research-oriented project for those deeply involved in the foundations of HoTT and its formalization. It provides a detailed, machine-checked exploration of the simplicial model.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The project is organized around the semantic and syntactic aspects of HoTT. It contains Lean files (`.lean`) that correspond to different sections and concepts outlined in the `README.md`, which also references specific sections of the foundational paper.

## Mentors and Influences

`HoTT-Model` is directly influenced by foundational research in Homotopy Type Theory, particularly the simplicial model, and contributes to the ongoing effort of formalizing advanced type theory and category theory concepts.
