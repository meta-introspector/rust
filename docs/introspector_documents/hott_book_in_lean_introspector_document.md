# HoTT-Book-in-Lean Introspector Document

## Overview

`hott-book-in-lean` is a personal project focused on formalizing the initial chapters of the Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) book using the Lean theorem prover. It serves as a self-learning endeavor to understand and implement HoTT concepts in a formal setting.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **HoTT Book Formalization**: Aims to translate definitions, theorems, and exercises from the HoTT book into Lean's formal language.
*   **Self-Learning Focus**: Primarily a project for personal educational development and exploration of HoTT concepts in Lean.
*   **Independent Implementations**: Contains some independently constructed proofs and definitions, offering alternative perspectives to existing formalizations.

## Usage

This repository is useful for individuals who want to follow along with the HoTT book and see its concepts formalized in Lean. It can serve as a supplementary resource for learning both HoTT and Lean.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The repository contains Lean source files (`.lean`) corresponding to chapters or sections of the HoTT book. The `README.md` provides a brief overview and disclaimer about its purpose.

## Mentors and Influences

This project is directly influenced by the HoTT book and the Lean theorem prover. It contributes to the growing body of formalized mathematics in Lean.
