# HOTTBOX Introspector Document

## Overview

`HOTTBOX` (Higher Order Tensors ToolBOX) is a Python library designed for tensor decompositions, statistical analysis, visualization, feature extraction, regression, and non-linear classification of multi-dimensional data. Despite its name, it is *not* directly related to Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), but rather focuses on numerical and statistical operations with tensors.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **Tensor Decompositions**: Provides tools for various tensor decomposition methods.
*   **Statistical Analysis**: Offers functionalities for statistical analysis of multi-dimensional data.
*   **Data Visualization**: Includes capabilities for visualizing tensor data.
*   **Feature Extraction**: Supports extracting features from multi-dimensional datasets.
*   **Regression and Classification**: Enables regression and non-linear classification tasks on tensor data.
*   **Python-based**: Implemented in Python, making it accessible to data scientists and researchers familiar with the Python ecosystem.

## Usage

`HOTTBOX` can be installed via `pip` or by cloning its GitHub repository. It uses `pipenv` for environment management and `pytest` for testing. Tutorials are available in a separate repository (`hottbox-tutorials`).

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The repository contains Python source code within the `hottbox/` directory, along with documentation (`docs/`), CI/CD configurations (`.github/`, `ci_scripts/`, `docker/`), and various project configuration files.

## Mentors and Influences

`HOTTBOX` is influenced by the field of tensor analysis and its applications in data science and machine learning. It aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for working with higher-order tensors.
