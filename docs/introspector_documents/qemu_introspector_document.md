# QEMU Introspector Document

## Overview

QEMU (Quick Emulator) is a versatile and open-source machine emulator and virtualizer. It can perform full system emulation, allowing it to run operating systems and programs designed for one machine architecture on a different one. Additionally, QEMU can provide userspace API virtualization, enabling binaries compiled for one architecture to run on a host with a different architecture.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **Full System Emulation**: Emulates entire computer systems, including CPU, memory, and peripherals, allowing guest operating systems to run without modification.
*   **Userspace Emulation**: Translates CPU instructions and system calls, enabling binaries from one architecture to run on another.
*   **Virtualization Integration**: Can integrate with hypervisors like Xen and KVM to achieve near-native performance for virtualized guests.
*   **Cross-Architecture Development**: Essential for developing and testing software for different CPU architectures without requiring physical hardware.
*   **Flexible Use Cases**: Can be used directly by users for fine-grained control or integrated into higher-level management layers like libvirt.

## Usage

QEMU is widely used in virtualization, embedded systems development, cross-compilation, and security research. Developers use it to test software on various architectures, and system administrators use it for running virtual machines. It is typically invoked from the command line with extensive options for configuration.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The repository contains a large and complex codebase organized into various components for different architectures, devices, and functionalities (e.g., `target/`, `hw/`, `system/`, `accel/`). It includes comprehensive documentation in the `docs/` directory, build scripts, and contribution guidelines.

## Mentors and Influences

QEMU is a significant project in the open-source virtualization and emulation space. It is influenced by the principles of open-source development and the need for flexible and powerful tools for system emulation and virtualization.
