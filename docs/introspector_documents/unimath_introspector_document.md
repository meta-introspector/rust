# UniMath Introspector Document

## Overview

`UniMath` is a comprehensive Coq library dedicated to formalizing a significant portion of mathematics from a univalent perspective. It is a community-driven effort to build a foundational library for univalent mathematics within the Coq proof assistant.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **Univalent Mathematics Formalization**: Implements mathematical concepts based on the principles of Univalent Foundations, where isomorphic types are identified.
*   **Coq Implementation**: Developed in Coq, leveraging its capabilities for rigorous formal verification of mathematical theories.
*   **Extensive Coverage**: Aims to cover a broad range of mathematical topics, contributing to a unified and coherent body of formalized knowledge.
*   **Community Support**: Supported by a dedicated community, offering help, discussions, and bug reporting channels (e.g., Zulip, GitHub issues).
*   **Interactive Documentation**: Provides automatically generated documentation (alectryon and rocqdoc) that allows users to step through proofs and navigate definitions.

## Usage

`UniMath` can be used as a dependency in other Coq projects. It can also be explored interactively in a web browser. Detailed installation instructions and guides are available in its documentation.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The repository contains Coq source files (`.v` files) organized into various mathematical domains. It also includes extensive documentation in the `documentation/` directory, covering setup, guides, tutorials, and contribution guidelines.

## Mentors and Influences

`UniMath` is deeply influenced by the principles of Univalent Foundations and the capabilities of the Coq proof assistant. It represents a major effort in the formalization of modern mathematics.
