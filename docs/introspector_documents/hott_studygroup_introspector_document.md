# HoTT-StudyGroup Introspector Document

## Overview

`HoTT-StudyGroup` is a repository used to organize and share resources for a study group on Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) in TÃ¼bingen. It provides a schedule of topics discussed, relevant articles, books, and links, serving as a collaborative learning platform for participants.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **Study Group Coordination**: Facilitates the organization of a HoTT study group, including meeting schedules and discussion topics.
*   **Curated Resources**: Compiles a list of essential readings, including the official HoTT book, video lectures, and nLab articles.
*   **Discussion Summaries**: Provides summaries of past discussions, covering foundational concepts of dependent type theory, identity types, univalence, higher inductive types, and synthetic homotopy theory.
*   **Computer Implementations**: Lists various computer implementations of HoTT in proof assistants like Coq, Agda, and Lean, offering practical avenues for exploration.

## Usage

This repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning HoTT, whether as part of a study group or for self-paced learning. The structured schedule and curated links provide a clear path for understanding complex topics.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The repository primarily consists of a `README.md` file that acts as the central hub for information, including the schedule, discussion points, and external links. It also contains a `pdfs` folder for course notes.

## Mentors and Influences

This project is driven by the academic community interested in Homotopy Type Theory, providing a practical example of collaborative learning and knowledge sharing in formal mathematics.
