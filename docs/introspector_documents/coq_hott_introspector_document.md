# Coq-HoTT Introspector Document

## Overview

`Coq-HoTT` is a library that formalizes homotopy-theoretic ideas within the Coq proof assistant. It is a significant development in the field of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), interpreting propositional equality as homotopy and type isomorphism as homotopy equivalence. This allows for a deep connection between logical constructions in type theory and homotopically-invariant constructions in topology.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **Homotopy Type Theory Formalization**: Provides a formal development of HoTT concepts in Coq, drawing inspiration from Vladimir Voevodsky's Foundations library.
*   **Homotopical Interpretation**: Establishes a direct link between type theory and abstract homotopy theory, where logical elements gain homotopical meaning.
*   **Integration with Coq**: Designed to be used within the Coq proof assistant, leveraging its capabilities for formal verification.
*   **Cross-Pollination**: Shares ideas and concepts with other HoTT formalization efforts, such as `HoTT-Agda`.

## Usage

The `Coq-HoTT` library can be used as any other Coq library. For integration into other Coq projects, specific arguments (`-arg -noinit`, `-arg -indices-matter`) need to be passed to `_CoqProject`.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The project contains Coq source files (`.v` files) that define the formalization. It also includes documentation files like `INSTALL.md` and `STYLE.md`.

## Mentors and Influences

This project is a key part of the broader Homotopy Type Theory formalization effort, influenced by foundational work in type theory and homotopy theory. It is developed and maintained by a community of researchers and formal methods enthusiasts.
