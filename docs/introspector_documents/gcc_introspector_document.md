# GCC Introspector Document

## Overview

GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is a highly optimizing, free software compiler produced by the GNU Project. It supports various programming languages, including C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, Go, and D. GCC is a fundamental component of the GNU toolchain and is widely used in the development of open-source software and operating systems.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **Multi-Language Support**: Compiles code written in a wide array of programming languages.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Available on numerous hardware architectures and operating systems.
*   **Optimization**: Includes advanced optimization techniques to generate efficient and high-performance code.
*   **Extensibility**: Designed with a modular architecture that allows for the addition of new languages and architectures.
*   **Free Software**: Distributed under the GNU General Public License, promoting software freedom and community collaboration.

## Usage

GCC is primarily used by developers to compile source code into executable programs or libraries. It is a critical tool in software development, embedded systems, and operating system development. Its command-line interface provides extensive options for controlling the compilation process.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The repository contains the source code for the GCC compiler, its various language frontends, and supporting libraries. Key directories include `gcc/` (compiler core), `libgcc/` (runtime library), `libstdc++-v3/` (C++ standard library), and `libiberty/` (utility functions). It also includes `INSTALL` and `MAINTAINERS` files.

## Mentors and Influences

GCC is a cornerstone of the free software movement, initiated by Richard Stallman as part of the GNU Project. It is influenced by decades of compiler design research and continues to be a leading open-source compiler, driven by a global community of developers.
