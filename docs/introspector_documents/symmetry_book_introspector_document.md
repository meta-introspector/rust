# SymmetryBook Introspector Document

## Overview

`SymmetryBook` is a textbook project written in the univalent style, focusing on the presence of symmetry in logic from an early stage. It aims to provide an accessible introduction to group theory and related concepts within the framework of univalent mathematics, emphasizing informal explanations and clear notation.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **Univalent Textbook**: Presents mathematical concepts, particularly group theory, from a univalent perspective.
*   **Emphasis on Symmetry**: Highlights the role of symmetry in logic and mathematics.
*   **Informal Style**: Prioritizes clarity and ease of understanding with minimal formal notation, especially for introductory sections.
*   **Detailed Style Guide**: Provides comprehensive guidelines for writing in the univalent style, covering terminology, notation, and formatting.
*   **Interactive Visualizations**: Includes interactive elements, such as an icosahedron and a Cayley diagram, to enhance understanding of abstract concepts.

## Usage

This book is intended for students and researchers interested in learning group theory and univalent mathematics. It can be compiled from source using `make` and offers a unique approach to understanding symmetry in a formal context.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The repository contains the LaTeX source for the book, along with a `Makefile` for compilation and assets for interactive visualizations. The `README.md` serves as an introduction to the book's philosophy and style.

## Mentors and Influences

`SymmetryBook` is influenced by the principles of Univalent Foundations and aims to make these advanced mathematical ideas more accessible through a carefully crafted pedagogical approach.
