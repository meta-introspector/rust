# Groupoid Model in Lean 4 Introspector Document

## Overview

`groupoid_model_in_lean4` (also referred to as HoTTLean) is a Lean project that formalizes the meta-theory of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) using the groupoid model. This formalization aims to serve as a foundational basis for a potential HoTT mode within the Lean theorem prover.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **Formalization of HoTT's Meta-Theory**: Provides a rigorous, machine-checked formalization of the groupoid model of Homotopy Type Theory.
*   **Foundation for HoTT Mode in Lean**: Intended to be the underlying formal framework for future integration of HoTT directly into the Lean theorem prover.
*   **Dependency on Polynomial Functors**: Relies on a separate formalization of polynomial functors, indicating a modular approach to its development.
*   **Lean Documentation and Dependency Graph**: Offers web-based documentation and a dependency graph to visualize the progress and structure of the formalization.

## Usage

This project is primarily a foundational formalization. Users would typically interact with it as a dependency for other Lean projects that delve into Homotopy Type Theory. It uses `lake` for dependency management and building.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The project contains Lean source files (`.lean`) that define the formalization. It also includes a `README.md` and potentially other configuration files related to `lake`.

## Mentors and Influences

This project is deeply rooted in Homotopy Type Theory and the Lean theorem proving ecosystem. Its development is influenced by the principles of formal verification and the ongoing efforts to formalize advanced mathematical theories.
