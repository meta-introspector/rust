# Lean 4 Introspector Document

## Overview

Lean 4 is a powerful interactive theorem prover and functional programming language. It is designed for both formal verification of mathematical theorems and for developing reliable software. Lean 4 builds upon its predecessor, Lean 3, with significant improvements in performance, metaprogramming capabilities, and a more robust foundation for formalizing mathematics.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **Interactive Theorem Prover**: Enables users to write and verify mathematical proofs in a formal system.
*   **Functional Programming Language**: Supports functional programming paradigms, allowing for the development of executable code alongside formal proofs.
*   **Metaprogramming**: Features advanced metaprogramming facilities, allowing users to extend the language and build powerful automation for proof development.
*   **Formal Verification**: Provides a rigorous environment for ensuring the correctness of mathematical statements and software.
*   **Community and Documentation**: Supported by an active community and extensive documentation, including tutorials for theorem proving and functional programming.

## Usage

Lean 4 is used by mathematicians, computer scientists, and logicians for formalizing mathematics, developing verified software, and research in type theory and proof assistants. It can be installed and built from source, and its usage is guided by comprehensive documentation and tutorials.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The repository contains the source code for the Lean 4 theorem prover and compiler, along with documentation, examples, and contribution guidelines. Key components include the Lean kernel, compiler, and standard library.

## Mentors and Influences

Lean 4 is the latest iteration of the Lean theorem prover, influenced by decades of research in type theory, proof assistants, and functional programming languages. It aims to be a state-of-the-art tool for formal mathematics and verified software.
