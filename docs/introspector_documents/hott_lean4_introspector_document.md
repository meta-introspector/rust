# HoTT_Lean4 Introspector Document

## Overview

`HoTT_Lean4` appears to be a Lean 4 project focused on the foundational aspects of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT). Given the presence of `Basic_types.lean`, it likely aims to define and explore the fundamental types and structures within HoTT using the Lean 4 theorem prover.

## Key Features and Purpose

*   **Basic HoTT Type Definitions**: Likely contains formalizations of core HoTT types and their properties.
*   **Lean 4 Implementation**: Developed for the Lean 4 theorem prover.
*   **Foundational Work**: Contributes to the basic building blocks for more advanced HoTT formalizations in Lean 4.

## Usage

This repository would serve as a foundational library for other Lean 4 projects that require basic HoTT definitions. It is likely used by researchers and developers exploring the theoretical underpinnings of HoTT in Lean.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The project currently contains a `src` directory with `Basic_types.lean`, suggesting a focus on fundamental definitions. The `README.md` is minimal, indicating an early stage of development or a project primarily intended for internal use or as a dependency.

## Mentors and Influences

This project is influenced by the principles of Homotopy Type Theory and the capabilities of the Lean 4 theorem prover for formalizing mathematics.
