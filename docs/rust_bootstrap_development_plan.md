# Rust Bootstrap Development Plan

This document outlines a phased strategic plan for the `rust-bootstrap` project, aiming to achieve a fully functional Rust-native build system capable of building the Rust compiler from source on ARM64 Termux, ultimately replacing `x.py`.

This plan synthesizes and sequences work described across various Change Requests (CRQs) and ongoing development efforts.

## Overall Goal
Achieve a fully functional `rust-bootstrap` that can build the Rust compiler from source on ARM64 Termux, replacing `x.py`.

## Phased Plan

### Phase 1: Core Build Orchestration & Git Analysis (Current Focus)
*   **Objective:** Ensure `rust-bootstrap` can successfully orchestrate basic Rust compiler builds and perform comprehensive Git repository analysis.
*   **Key Tasks (from CRQs and recent commits):**
    *   **Complete Git Data Extraction:** Finish implementing `get_all_blobs`, `get_all_trees`, `get_all_tags`, and `get_all_refs` functions (as detailed in `docs/internal_gemini_tasks/git_analysis_instructions.md`).
    *   **Integrate Parquet Reporting:** Ensure all extracted Git data is correctly converted to Arrow `RecordBatch`es and written to Parquet files.
    *   **Refactor Command Executor:** Complete the refactoring of duplicate command execution code (as per `CRQ: Refactor Duplicate Command Executor Code in rust-bootstrap`).
    *   **Implement Build Configuration Report:** Ensure the `build_config.parquet` report is fully functional.
    *   **Enhance Command Execution Metrics:** Verify that command execution metrics (timing, etc.) are accurately captured and reported.
    *   **Implement Initial `x.py` Porting:** Continue porting core `x.py` build orchestration logic to `rust-bootstrap`.

### Phase 2: Full `x.py` Feature Parity & Bootstrapping
*   **Objective:** Replicate all essential `x.py` functionalities within `rust-bootstrap`, enabling a complete self-hosting bootstrap process.
*   **Key Tasks (from CRQs):**
    *   **Implement `x.py` Command Parsing:** Ensure `rust-bootstrap` can correctly parse and translate all relevant `x.py` commands.
    *   **Orchestrate `cargo` Commands for Build Stages:** Implement the full multi-stage `cargo` orchestration for the Rust compiler build.
    *   **Implement Cross-Compilation Support:** Ensure `rust-bootstrap` correctly handles cross-compilation for ARM64 Termux.
    *   **Implement Multi-Stage Bootstrapping:** Integrate `stage0` detection with build orchestration to perform the full bootstrap.
    *   **Implement `build` and `install` Subcommands:** Add user-facing `build` and `install` subcommands to `rust-bootstrap`.
    *   **Configuration Migration:** Migrate all remaining `x.py` configuration logic to `rust-bootstrap`.
    *   **Toolchain Management:** Replicate `x.py`'s toolchain management and snapshot fetching capabilities.

### Phase 3: Testing, Verification & Quality Assurance
*   **Objective:** Ensure the stability, correctness, and quality of the `rust-bootstrap` tool and the bootstrapped Rust toolchain.
*   **Key Tasks (from CRQs):**
    *   **Develop Unit Tests:** Write comprehensive unit tests for `rust-bootstrap` components.
    *   **Integrate with Existing Rust Test Suite:** Ensure the bootstrapped compiler passes a significant portion of official Rust tests.
    *   **Perform End-to-End Testing:** Verify `rust-bootstrap` can build a functional Rust toolchain from scratch.
    *   **Integrate Code Quality Tooling:** Consistently apply `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.

### Phase 4: Documentation & Refinement
*   **Objective:** Maintain comprehensive and up-to-date documentation, and continuously refine the codebase for extreme modularity and maintainability.
*   **Key Tasks (from CRQs and recent commits):**
    *   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Update all `README.md` files, add inline comments, and maintain architectural documents.
    *   **Apply Extreme Modularity:** Continuously refactor code to adhere to the "one function per file" principle.
    *   **Update `GEMINI.md`:** Keep my own memory updated with project progress.

## Immediate Next Steps

1.  **Complete the current rebase:** Continue rewording any remaining commits as prompted by Git.
2.  **Verify the rebase:** Once the rebase is complete, run `git log` to ensure the history is clean and as intended.
3.  **Push the rebased branch:** If you are satisfied with the rebased history, push your changes to the remote. If this is a shared branch, consider `git push --force-with-lease`.
4.  **Resume `rust-bootstrap` development:** Once the Git history is clean, you can pick up development. A good starting point would be to continue with the Git data extraction tasks outlined in `docs/internal_gemini_tasks/git_analysis_instructions.md`.
