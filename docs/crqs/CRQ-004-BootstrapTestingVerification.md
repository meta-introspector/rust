# Change Request (CRQ): Rust Bootstrap - Testing and Initial Verification

## 1. Objective
To ensure the functional correctness and stability of the `rust-bootstrap` crate and the bootstrapped Rust toolchain through comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

## 2. Scope
This CRQ covers:
*   Development of unit tests for `rust-bootstrap` components.
*   Integration of `rust-bootstrap` with the existing Rust compiler test suite.
*   Execution of end-to-end tests to verify the full bootstrap process.

## 3. Prerequisites
*   Completion of CRQ: `rust_bootstrap_build_orchestration.md`.
*   A successfully bootstrapped Rust compiler (even if basic functionality).

## 4. Procedure

### Step 4.1: Develop Unit Tests for `rust-bootstrap`.
*   **Action:** Write comprehensive unit tests for individual modules and functions within `rust-bootstrap`. Focus on testing core logic, utility functions, and data transformations. (Refer to `rust_bootstrap_development_sop.md` section 4.5.a).
*   **Tool:** `write_file`, `run_shell_command` (`cargo test`)

### Step 4.2: Integrate with Existing Rust Test Suite.
*   **Action:** Explore and implement methods to integrate the `rust-bootstrap` output (the bootstrapped compiler) with the existing official Rust compiler test suite. The goal is to ensure the compiler produced by `rust-bootstrap` passes a significant portion of the standard Rust tests. (Refer to `rust_bootstrap_development_sop.md` section 4.5.b).
*   **Tool:** `read_file`, `run_shell_command`

### Step 4.3: Perform End-to-End Testing.
*   **Action:** Conduct end-to-end tests to verify that `rust-bootstrap` can successfully build the Rust compiler from scratch on the ARM64 Termux environment. This involves running the full bootstrap process and confirming the output is a functional Rust toolchain. (Refer to `rust_bootstrap_development_sop.md` section 4.5.c).
*   **Tool:** `run_shell_command`

## 5. Verification
*   **Step 5.1:** All unit tests for `rust-bootstrap` pass successfully.
*   **Step 5.2:** The bootstrapped compiler passes a significant and increasing percentage of the official Rust test suite.
*   **Step 5.3:** A fully functional Rust toolchain is produced by the end-to-end bootstrap process.

## 6. Tools Used
*   `run_shell_command`: For executing `cargo test`, running the bootstrapped compiler, and executing official Rust tests.
*   `write_file`: For creating new test files.
*   `read_file`: For analyzing existing test suite structures.
