# CRQ-20250904-001: Document Build Attempts and Process

## 1. Change Request Title
Document Build Attempts and Process for Vendored Dependencies (CMake and UV)

## 2. Requestor
Gemini CLI Agent

## 3. Date of Request
2025-09-04

## 4. Description of Change
This Change Request initiates the formal documentation of the build attempts and analysis performed for vendored dependencies, specifically `cmake` and `uv`, within the Termux environment. The documentation will capture the steps taken, observations, and rationale, ensuring reproducibility and adherence to specified quality and process standards.

## 5. Justification for Change
To prevent loss of critical information, ensure reproducibility of build attempts, and establish a clear, auditable record of the development process. Adherence to ISO 9000, ITIL, GMP, Six Sigma, C4, and UML principles will enhance the quality, control, and understanding of the build procedures. This documentation serves as a foundational element for future development and troubleshooting.

## 6. Scope of Change
*   Creation of a new comprehensive log file (`docs/build_attempts_log.md`)
*   Creation of executable shell scripts (`scripts/build_attempts/*.sh`) for each significant command sequence, enabling reproducibility.
*   Documentation of the analysis performed on `termux-packages` build scripts for `cmake` and `uv`.
*   Recording of all commands executed and their outcomes.

## 7. Affected Systems/Components
*   `docs/` directory (new log file and CRQ)
*   `scripts/` directory (new build attempt scripts)
*   Vendored `cmake` source (`vendor/cmake/`)
*   Vendored `uv` source (`vendor/uv/`)
*   Termux environment and build tools

## 8. Risk Assessment
*   **Low:** The change primarily involves documentation and script creation, with no direct modification to core project code or production systems.
*   **Potential for Error:** Minor risk of incorrect command transcription or incomplete documentation. Mitigated by careful review and structured approach.

## 9. Rollback Plan
Not applicable, as this change is additive (documentation and new scripts). In case of errors in documentation, direct correction will be applied.

## 10. Approvals
*   **Requested By:** Gemini CLI Agent
*   **Approved By:** User (Implicit approval through instruction)

## 11. Implementation Steps (High-Level)
1.  Create `docs/build_attempts_log.md`.
2.  Create `scripts/build_attempts/` directory.
3.  Populate `build_attempts_log.md` with detailed narrative.
4.  Create individual shell scripts within `scripts/build_attempts/` for each command sequence.
5.  Commit all new files.

## 12. Verification Plan
*   Confirm existence and content of `docs/build_attempts_log.md`.
*   Confirm existence and executability of scripts in `scripts/build_attempts/`.
*   Verify that scripts accurately reflect documented commands.

## 13. Communication Plan
Inform the user upon completion of documentation and script creation.
