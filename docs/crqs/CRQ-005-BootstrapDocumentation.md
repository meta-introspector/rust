# Change Request (CRQ): Rust Bootstrap - Documentation

## 1. Objective
To comprehensively document the development process, architecture, and usage of the `rust-bootstrap` crate, ensuring clarity, maintainability, and ease of understanding for future development and collaboration.

## 2. Scope
This CRQ covers:
*   Updating `README.md` files within the `rust-bootstrap` crate and relevant parent directories.
*   Adding inline comments to the Rust code to explain complex logic and design decisions.
*   Creating or updating any necessary architectural or design documents related to `rust-bootstrap`.

## 3. Prerequisites
*   Completion of CRQ: `rust_bootstrap_testing_and_initial_verification.md`.
*   A stable and functional `rust-bootstrap` crate.

## 4. Procedure

### Step 4.4: Document the Process.
*   **Action:** Update `README.md` files within the `rust-bootstrap` crate and any other relevant `README.md` files in parent directories (e.g., `crates/rust-bootstrap/README.md`, `src/README.md` if applicable) to reflect the current state, usage, and build instructions for `rust-bootstrap`. Add clear and concise comments to the Rust code, explaining *why* certain design choices were made, complex algorithms, or non-obvious logic. (Refer to `rust_bootstrap_development_sop.md` section 5).
*   **Tool:** `write_file`, `replace`

## 5. Verification
*   **Step 5.1:** Review `README.md` files to ensure they are up-to-date, accurate, and provide sufficient information for a new developer to understand and use `rust-bootstrap`.
*   **Step 5.2:** Conduct a code review to ensure that inline comments are clear, concise, and effectively explain the purpose and logic of the code.

## 6. Tools Used
*   `write_file`: For creating and updating documentation files.
*   `replace`: For modifying existing documentation and adding comments to code.
