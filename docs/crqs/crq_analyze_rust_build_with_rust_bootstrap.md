# CRQ: Analyze Rust Compiler Build with rust-bootstrap

## Objective
Utilize the `rust-bootstrap` tool to analyze the Git repository of the newly built Rust compiler and generate build reports, demonstrating its current management and reporting capabilities.

## Scope
*   Ensure the nightly Rust compiler has been successfully built and installed on Termux via `x.py` (as per `crq_build_rust_termux_xpy.md`).
*   Navigate to the root of the Rust project (`/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rust`).
*   Execute `cargo run -p rust-bootstrap -- /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/rust`.
*   Observe the output of `rust-bootstrap` to confirm successful execution of Git analysis and any other implemented reporting features.

## Impact
Provides initial data and insights into the Rust compiler's build process through `rust-bootstrap`'s Git analysis and reporting features. This validates the current functionality of `rust-bootstrap` and lays the groundwork for more comprehensive build analysis.

## Verification Steps
*   The `cargo run -p rust-bootstrap` command executes successfully without runtime errors.
*   The output from `rust-bootstrap` indicates that Git repository analysis was performed.
*   (Future: Confirm the generation of Parquet files containing build configuration and Git analysis data in a designated output directory, once this feature is fully implemented and verifiable.)

## Dependencies
*   Successful completion of `crq_build_rust_termux_xpy.md`.
*   `rust-bootstrap` crate is present and compilable within the Rust project workspace.
