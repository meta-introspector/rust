# Change Request (CRQ): Rust Bootstrap - Code Quality Tooling Integration

## 1. Objective
To integrate and consistently apply code quality tools such as `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` within the `rust-bootstrap` development workflow, ensuring adherence to Rust coding standards and identifying potential code issues.

## 2. Scope
This CRQ covers:
*   Integration of `cargo fmt` for code formatting.
*   Integration of `cargo clippy` for linting and static analysis.
*   Establishing a routine for running these tools during development and before commits.

## 3. Prerequisites
*   Completion of CRQ: `rust_bootstrap_modularity_application.md`.
*   A compilable `rust-bootstrap` crate.

## 4. Procedure

### Step 4.5.2: Integrate Code Quality Tooling.
*   **Action:** Configure the `rust-bootstrap` project to use `cargo fmt` for consistent code formatting and `cargo clippy` for static analysis and linting. Establish a practice of running these tools regularly during development, ideally before every commit or pull request. Address any warnings or errors reported by these tools to maintain high code quality.
*   **Tool:** `run_shell_command` (`cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`)

## 5. Verification
*   **Step 5.1:** Running `cargo fmt --check` in the `rust-bootstrap` directory reports no formatting issues.
*   **Step 5.2:** Running `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` in the `rust-bootstrap` directory reports no warnings or errors.
*   **Step 5.3:** Code reviews confirm that the codebase adheres to established Rust coding standards.

## 6. Tools Used
*   `run_shell_command`: For executing `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.
