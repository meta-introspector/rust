# CRQ-20250905-001: Comprehensive Rustc Build System Analysis

## Description
Perform a detailed analysis of the Rust compiler's bootstrap build system (`x.py`, `bootstrap.py`, core Rust crates, `Cargo.toml` files, `Cargo.lock`) to understand its architecture, dependency management, and compilation flow.

## Justification
Current attempts to integrate new crates are failing due to a lack of understanding of the complex build environment. A thorough analysis is required to establish a robust integration strategy.

## Assigned Agent
Gemini (acting as "Build System Architect")

## Due Date
End of Day, September 5, 2025 (or next 3-5 turns).

## Deliverables
*   Completed outputs of SOP-BSA-001, SOP-BSA-002, and SOP-BSA-003.
*   A summary report outlining the key findings and proposing a high-level strategy for integrating new crates.

## Status
In Progress.
