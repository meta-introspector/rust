# Change Request (CRQ): Rust Bootstrap - Modularity Application

## 1. Objective
To continuously apply the principles of extreme modularity throughout the `rust-bootstrap` codebase, ensuring that code is actively refactored and split into smaller, single-purpose units as development progresses.

## 2. Scope
This CRQ covers the ongoing process of:
*   Identifying opportunities for code splitting and refactoring.
*   Applying the "one function per file per basic block" principle.
*   Ensuring the codebase remains highly modular, maintainable, and clean.

## 3. Prerequisites
*   Completion of CRQ: `rust_bootstrap_documentation.md`.
*   Familiarity with the project's "Extreme Modularity Refactoring" SOPs.

## 4. Procedure

### Step 4.5.1: Apply Extreme Modularity Principles.
*   **Action:** Throughout all phases of `rust-bootstrap` development, actively identify code blocks or functions that can be further broken down into smaller, more focused units. Apply the principles outlined in `extreme_modularity_refactoring_sop.md` and `gemini_extreme_modularity_refactoring_sop.md` to refactor and split code into new files as needed. This is an ongoing process, not a one-time task.
*   **Tool:** `write_file`, `replace`

## 5. Verification
*   **Step 5.1:** Regular code reviews confirm that new code and refactored sections adhere to the extreme modularity principles (e.g., small file sizes, single-purpose functions).
*   **Step 5.2:** The overall codebase structure remains clean, organized, and easy to navigate, reflecting a high degree of modularity.

## 6. Tools Used
*   `write_file`: For creating new files for extracted code units.
*   `replace`: For updating call sites and `mod.rs` files after code splitting.
