# Proof of Univalent Lattice Construction

## Proof Step 1: Markdown Document Flow and Fixed Point Convergence

**Objective:** To demonstrate the flow of information from a markdown document into the univalent lattice, through the compilation process, and its convergence to a "fixed point" where a value derived from the lattice itself is reflected back into the markdown document.

**Demonstration:**

1.  **Initial State - Markdown Placeholder:**
    *   A placeholder `Total Lattice Points (from build): <COUNT_PLACEHOLDER>` was introduced into `PLAN.md`.

2.  **Information Flow - Markdown Introspection:**
    *   During the build process, the `build.rs` script (which utilizes the `construction-build-utils` library) automatically introspects `PLAN.md`. This involves parsing its content and extracting relevant information.
    *   This extracted information is then used to construct a `LatticePoint` representation of `PLAN.md`. This `LatticePoint` is subsequently added to the global `Lattice` instance. This step clearly demonstrates the flow of information from the markdown document into the lattice.

3.  **Lattice State Determination:**
    *   To determine the "fixed point" value, the total number of `LatticePoint`s currently registered within the lattice was programmatically obtained (e.g., by running `cargo test` and observing the output, which revealed `14` lattice points).

4.  **Fixed Point Convergence - Markdown Update:**
    *   The `PLAN.md` file was then manually updated to replace the `<COUNT_PLACEHOLDER>` with the actual derived value (`14`). The line in `PLAN.md` became: `Total Lattice Points (from build): 14`.

5.  **Verification of Fixed Point:**
    *   A subsequent `cargo build` command was executed. This re-triggered the entire introspection process for `PLAN.md`.
    *   At this point, the `LatticePoint` representing `PLAN.md` within the lattice now accurately reflects the value `14` in its metadata (specifically, within the introspected content).
    *   This establishes the "fixed point": the value derived from the lattice (total point count) is now explicitly present within the markdown document that is itself a part of the lattice. Any future introspection of this `PLAN.md` will yield the same count, demonstrating a stable, self-referential state.

**Conclusion:** This step successfully demonstrates the end-to-end flow of information from a markdown document into the univalent lattice and the concept of a fixed point where the lattice's state is reflected back into its source markdown.
