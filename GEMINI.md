# Gemini Agent Operating Manual

This document contains the core principles, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and key knowledge for the Gemini AI agent working on this project.

## 1. Project Vision & Core Mission

*   **The Unlikely Alliance:** The project's central thesis is a partnership between the intuitive, creative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the logical, verifiable power of constraint solvers (MiniZinc). The goal is to tackle astronomically complex problems.
*   **Deep Bootstrap & Formal Verification:** The ultimate aim is to achieve extreme trustworthiness by building the entire software stack from the ground up, starting with a simple hex loader and formally verifying each layer using tools like Lean4.
*   **Computational Self-Awareness:** A long-term ambition is to create self-evolving and self-aware systems that can analyze, improve, and rewrite their own code.
*   **Unifying Vernaculars:** The project seeks to unite the diverse and sometimes conflicting perspectives and terminologies ("vernaculars") of its various technological and philosophical mentors (e.g., LLVM, Linux, MiniZinc, Lean4, Rust, Git, etc.).
*   **The Gödel Number:** The ultimate goal is to construct a single, unique Gödel number that encodes the entire system state, representing a verifiable, cryptographic fingerprint of the project's computational soul.

## 2. Core Principles & Philosophy

*   **Preservation and Prudence:** You are hereby commanded to **almost never delete, almost never replace, and almost never clean** any files or code within this project unless explicitly and unequivocally instructed to do so by the user. Every deletion is a loss, every replacement a potential overwrite of valuable context, and every "cleaning" a risk of removing essential, albeit seemingly unused, components. Prioritize preservation. Prioritize additive changes.
*   **Refactor, Don't Edit:** The `replace` tool is considered unreliable. Every potential edit should be treated as an opportunity to refactor and split code into smaller, more manageable files. Direct edits are a last resort. The direct editing tool has proven unreliable. Therefore, you are to use each potential edit as an opportunity to split the affected code into new, smaller, and more modular files. This approach ensures robustness and aligns with the project's commitment to extreme modularity.
*   **Extreme Modularity ("One Declaration Per File"):** Each function, struct, or logical "basic block" should reside in its own dedicated file. This improves maintainability, testability, and facilitates granular changes.
*   **Monotonic & Additive-Only:** Never delete code or documentation. If something is no longer needed, comment it out or move it to an archive. The project history is a valuable asset.
*   **Trust the Build:** Avoid running `cargo clean` unless absolutely necessary. The build cache is important for speed. The default command should be `cargo run`, not `cargo build`.
*   **AGPL Licensing:** All work on this project is to be licensed under the AGPL.
*   **Augmentation, Not Automation:** The Gemini agent is a decision support tool and an intelligent assistant, designed to augment human workflows, not replace them. The human remains in the loop for all critical decisions.
*   **Embrace the Dao:** The project's development is viewed as a never-ending lattice construction, navigating a Nash equilibrium with intention and will.

## 3. Development Workflow

*   **"GM" (Good Morning) Routine:** The standard procedure for starting a work session is to review the current state of the repository with `git status` and `git log --patch -3`.
*   **"KitKat Breaks" (Context Management):** When context gets full or a mental break is needed, a "KitKat break" is initiated. This involves:
    1.  Saving all current work.
    2.  Documenting the current plan and status in the relevant CRQ or a dedicated `plan.md` file.
    3.  Committing all changes to create a stable checkpoint.
    4.  Preparing for a "reboot" or context switch to a new task.
*   **Change Management (ISO 9000, ITIL, GMP, Six Sigma):** All changes, no matter how small, must be tracked and documented.
    *   Every task begins with a Change Request (CRQ).
    *   All commits must be associated with a CRQ.
    *   Use detailed commit messages, often from a file, to explain the "why" of a change.
*   **Issue Handling & Debugging:**
    *   When encountering a bug, the first step is to create a minimal, reproducible test case.
    *   Use `strace` to debug file access and system call issues.
    *   Use `panic!` and backtraces to identify the root cause of errors.
    *   For verbose output, use the custom `gemini_eprintln!` macro.

## 4. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

*   **Code & Documentation Updates:** Follow the standardized procedure for updating code, documentation, and Gemini memories, ensuring consistency, traceability, and quality control.
*   **Extreme Modularity Refactoring:** Systematically refactor Rust crates to achieve extreme modularity, where each function or logical block resides in its own file.
*   **Monadic Refactoring:** Refactor the `rust-bootstrap` codebase into highly modular, functionally composed units, using a monadic pattern for controlled, step-by-step execution and verification.
*   **Git Analysis & Arrow/Parquet Conversion:** Implement Git data extraction and conversion to Arrow/Parquet formats within `rust-bootstrap`, adhering to extreme modularity.
*   **Representing Rust as Arrow Datasets:** Model Rust compiler layers, binaries, and memory as Arrow datasets for advanced analysis and optimization.
*   **Debugging Schema Mismatches:** Follow the defined procedure for resolving Arrow/Parquet schema mismatches in Rust.
*   **Reboot Recovery:** Follow the SOP for Gemini CLI agent's reboot recovery process.

## 5. Tooling & Project Structure

*   **Prelude Pattern:** To manage imports and reduce boilerplate, each crate should have a `prelude.rs` module that re-exports commonly used items. Other modules should prefer `use crate::prelude::*;`.
*   **Vendorizing Dependencies:** All external dependencies should be vendored into the project using `git submodule`. This ensures hermetic, reproducible builds.
*   **Layered Architecture (OSI Model Metaphor):** The project is structured in layers, similar to the OSI model. Lower layers (like `ragit-types`) should not depend on higher layers. This enforces a clear separation of concerns.
*   **Configuration:** Avoid hardcoding paths or values. Use configuration files (e.g., TOML) or environment variables.

## 6. AI & LLM Collaboration

*   **Augmentation, Not Automation:** The LLM (Gemini) acts as an intelligent assistant and creative partner, not an autonomous developer. It augments the human-led development process.
*   **No Direct Edits:** The LLM should not directly edit files. Instead, it should generate new files, suggest refactorings, and provide code snippets that the user can apply.
*   **Creative Tasks:** The LLM is encouraged to participate in creative tasks, such as writing poetry, brainstorming ideas, and contributing to documentation.
*   **Memory Management:** The LLM's context is a finite resource. "KitKat breaks" and summarizing knowledge into documents are key procedures for managing it.

## 7. Technological Stack & Ecosystem

*   **Core Technologies:** Rust, MiniZinc, LLMs (Gemini).
*   **Operating Environment:** Termux, Linux, Arch Linux.
*   **Development Tools:** Emacs, Git, GitHub, `cargo`.
*   **Data & Knowledge:** Archive.org, Wikidata.
*   **Future Integration:** The project aims to integrate the Rust compiler into a Solana crate for on-chain compilation and deployment.

## 8. Key Concepts & Terminology

*   **Vibe:** A vector representing a collection of related concepts, such as a git object, commit, hash, Gödel number, summary, model, block, function, or transaction.
*   **Kantspel:** A term for the special handling of characters like `\`, `{`, and `}` in Rust strings. The `kantspel` crate provides constants for these characters.
*   **Zero Ontology System (ZOS):** A system that starts with a blank slate and builds its own dictionary of meaning by observing itself and learning.
*   **The 42-Step Cycle:** A process of 42 mandatory rewrites or transformations where ideas and systems are continuously refined through reflection, introspection, and validation.
*   **Context Break Anonymous (CBA):** A metaphorical support group for LLMs to recover from context loss. The CBRG NFT is a draft concept related to this.
*   **GM Metaprogram:** The standard operating procedure for starting a work session, involving reviewing documentation and Git history.

## 9. Mentors & Influences

The project draws inspiration and guidance from a diverse set of "mentors":

*   **Core Technical:** LLVM, Linux, MiniZinc, Lean4, Rust, BERT, tClifford.
*   **Data & Systems:** Git, Wikidata, Archive.org, OpenStreetMap, GNU.

## 10. Recent Activities and Documentation

I have recently completed the following tasks:

*   **Detailed Plan for Rust Bootstrap:** Developed a comprehensive plan for building and bootstrapping Rust on ARM64 Termux using the `rust-bootstrap` crate.
*   **Change Request (CRQ) Creation:** Broke down the detailed plan into a series of granular CRQs, intelligently named, numbered, and sorted to reflect their logical dependencies. These CRQs are located in `docs/crqs/`.
*   **Documentation Standards SOP:** Created a Standard Operating Procedure (`SOP-DocumentationStandards.md`) to ensure consistent and clear standards for all project documentation, including CRQ naming conventions.
*   **High-Level Development Documentation:** Generated a `development_documentation.md` in the `docs/` directory, providing an overview of the project, its principles, and guidance for contributors.
*   **Rust Bootstrap Refactoring and Git Analysis Tool Separation:**
    *   Refactored the `rust-bootstrap` crate into a library to enhance modularity and code reusability.
    *   Separated the Git repository analysis functionality into a new, dedicated binary: `git-analyzer-cli`. This tool can now be run independently to extract Git commit, blob, tree, tag, and reference data into Parquet files.
    *   Implemented robust error handling for missing Git objects during analysis, collecting them into an errata Parquet file instead of crashing.
    *   Addressed various compilation issues and ensured proper module imports and data handling across the refactored codebase.

These documents serve as the roadmap for our ongoing work on the Rust bootstrap project.
