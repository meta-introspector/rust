# Project-Specific Utilities: Bootstrap, Syscall Instrumentation, and Introspector Lattice Components (Part 1)

This index file (`project_utilities_01.txt`) lists `Cargo.toml` paths for internal project-specific utility crates. These crates provide specialized functionalities tailored to the project's needs.

**Crates included in this section:**
*   `./crates/rust-bootstrap/Cargo.toml`: Likely contains tools and logic for bootstrapping the Rust compiler within this project's context.
*   `./crates/syscall_instrumentation_macro/Cargo.toml`: A procedural macro designed for instrumenting system calls, potentially for analysis or debugging purposes.
*   `./crates/introspector/lattice/construction/Cargo.toml`: Part of the `introspector` crate, focusing on the construction of lattices.
*   `./crates/introspector/lattice/lattice-introspector/Cargo.toml`: The core introspection component for lattice structures.
*   `./crates/introspector/lattice/lattice-macros/Cargo.toml`: Procedural macros related to lattice operations.
*   `./crates/introspector/lattice/lattice-macros-test/Cargo.toml`: Tests for the lattice-related procedural macros.
*   `./crates/introspector/lattice/lattice-types/Cargo.toml`: Defines the data structures and types used within the lattice components of the `introspector` crate.
