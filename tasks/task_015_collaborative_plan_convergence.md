# Task ID: task_015_collaborative_plan_convergence

## Description
Establish a collaborative planning process where each project contributor develops an individual plan, followed by a convergence phase to synthesize these into a common, agreed-upon project plan. This task aims to leverage diverse perspectives and foster collective ownership of the project roadmap.

## Assigned To
[Unassigned]

## Status
Pending - Process Definition

## Rules for Collaborative Planning
1.  **Each user will make a plan for everyone.** Individual plans should consider the entire project's needs and goals, not just personal contributions.
2.  **The users will converge on a common plan.** The ultimate goal is to synthesize individual plans into a single, unified, and agreed-upon project roadmap.

## Instructions (Collaborative Process & Tools)

1.  **Individual Plan Development**:
    *   **Goal**: Each user (or small team) will develop a personal or team-specific plan for the next phase of the project.
    *   **Format**: Plans should be documented in Markdown files within a new `plans/individual/` directory. A suggested template for individual plans:
        ```markdown
        # Individual Plan: [Your Name/Team Name] - [Date]

        ## Vision for the Next Phase
        [Briefly describe your overall vision or key objectives.]

        ## Proposed Tasks
        [List specific tasks you propose to work on, referencing existing `tasks/task_XXX_*.md` where applicable, or proposing new ones. For new tasks, provide a brief description.]
        - Task ID: [e.g., task_001_build_notel]
          - Status: [e.g., Proposed, Ready to Start]
          - Estimated Effort: [e.g., 1 day, 3 hours]
          - Dependencies: [e.g., task_000_setup_dev_env]
        - New Task: [Brief description of new task]

        ## Resource Requirements
        [Any specific resources needed: e.g., hardware, software, external expertise.]

        ## Potential Challenges/Risks
        [Anticipated difficulties or risks.]

        ## Questions/Discussion Points
        [Topics for discussion during convergence.]
        ```
    *   **Submission**: Users will commit their individual plan files to Git.

2.  **Plan Review & Feedback**:
    *   **Goal**: All contributors will review each other's individual plans to understand different perspectives, identify overlaps, and provide constructive feedback.
    *   **Process**: Use Git's pull request mechanism for review, or dedicated discussion channels (e.g., Discord, GitHub Issues).

3.  **Convergence & Common Plan Synthesis**:
    *   **Goal**: Synthesize individual plans into a single, coherent, and commonly agreed-upon project plan.
    *   **Process**:
        *   **Facilitated Discussion**: Conduct a collaborative session (e.g., video call, dedicated chat) to discuss individual plans, resolve conflicts, and prioritize tasks.
        *   **Common Plan Document**: Create a new `plans/common_plan_[Date].md` file that consolidates the agreed-upon tasks, timelines, and responsibilities. This document will serve as the official project roadmap.
        *   **Task Status Updates**: Update the `Status` of tasks in `tasks/*.md` files based on the common plan (e.g., "Approved," "Scheduled").

## Expected Output/Results
*   Multiple individual plan files in `plans/individual/`.
*   A single, consolidated common project plan in `plans/common_plan_[Date].md`.
*   Updated task statuses in `tasks/*.md` files reflecting the common plan.

## Verification
*   Confirm that all individual plans are submitted and reviewed.
*   Verify that the common plan accurately reflects the consensus of the contributors.
*   Ensure task statuses are updated according to the common plan.

## How to Submit
1.  Create the `plans/individual/` directory.
2.  Each user will create their individual plan file in `plans/individual/`.
3.  Commit individual plans to Git.
4.  After convergence, create the `plans/common_plan_[Date].md` and commit it.
5.  Update relevant `tasks/*.md` files and commit those changes.
