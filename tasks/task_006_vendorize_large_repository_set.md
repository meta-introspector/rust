# Task ID: task_006_vendorize_large_repository_set

## Description
Develop a strategy and implement a phased approach for "vendorizing" a large set of 10,000 repositories linked from `https://github.com/meta-introspector/time`. This task aims to make these repositories accessible for analysis and integration within the project, while managing resource constraints and Git's limitations with a massive number of submodules.

## Instructions (Strategy Definition & Implementation)

1.  **Analyze `https://github.com/meta-introspector/time`**:
    *   Understand how the 10,000 repositories are linked or referenced within this project. Is it a list of URLs, a manifest file, or something else?
    *   Determine the best way to extract this list of repository URLs.

2.  **Evaluate Vendorization Strategies for Large Sets**:
    *   **Git Submodules (Limited Use)**: Directly adding 10,000 submodules is generally not recommended due to performance overhead, repository size, and potential Git client limitations. It might be feasible for a very small, curated subset.
    *   **Shallow Clones/Sparse Checkouts**: Consider using shallow clones or sparse checkouts if only a portion of each repository's history or content is needed.
    *   **Custom Cloning Script**: Develop a custom script that clones these repositories into a designated directory (e.g., `vendor/large_repo_set/`) without making them Git submodules. This provides local access without Git's submodule overhead.
    *   **Repository Management Tools**: Investigate existing tools designed for managing large numbers of repositories (e.g., Google's `repo` tool used in Android development, or custom solutions for monorepos).
    *   **On-Demand Fetching**: Explore a system where repositories are fetched only when needed, rather than all at once.

3.  **Phased Implementation Plan**:
    *   Propose a phased approach, starting with a small sample of repositories to test the chosen strategy and assess resource impact (disk space, network, CPU).
    *   Define criteria for selecting the initial sample (e.g., by size, activity, relevance).

4.  **Resource Management Considerations**:
    *   **Disk Space**: Estimate the total disk space required for 10,000 repositories and plan for storage.
    *   **Network Bandwidth**: Account for the significant network bandwidth required for initial cloning and subsequent updates.
    *   **Git Performance**: Consider the impact on Git operations (status, commit, clone) with such a large number of repositories.

## Expected Output/Results
*   A detailed strategy document outlining the chosen approach for vendorizing the 10,000 repositories, including justification for the chosen method, a phased implementation plan, and resource considerations.
*   (Optional) A small proof-of-concept script demonstrating the chosen vendorization strategy for a subset of repositories.

## Verification
*   Review the strategy document for feasibility, scalability, and resource efficiency.
*   (For proof-of-concept) Verify that the chosen method successfully "vendorizes" the sample repositories and that they are accessible for analysis.

## How to Submit
1.  Add the strategy document and any proof-of-concept code to Git.
2.  Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
3.  Update the status of this task in `tasks/task_006_vendorize_large_repository_set.md` to "Completed - Strategy Definition".
