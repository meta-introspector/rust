# Task ID: task_013_build_slime_mold_simulation

## Description
Build the `ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation` crate, which contains the `slime_mold.rs` implementation, to ensure it compiles successfully and is ready for execution or further development. This is a foundational step for restarting the "slime mold project."

## Assigned To
[Unassigned]

## Status
Pending

## Instructions

1.  Navigate to the `ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation` crate directory:
    ```bash
    cd crates/introspector/crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation
    ```
2.  Clean any previous build artifacts (optional, but good practice):
    ```bash
    cargo clean
    ```
3.  Build the project in release mode, redirecting output to a log file:
    ```bash
    cargo build --release &> ../../../../../tasks/results/task_013_slime_mold_build.log
    ```
    (Note: The `&>` redirects both stdout and stderr. The path to the log file is relative to the project root.)
4.  Return to the project root:
    ```bash
    cd -
    ```

## Expected Output/Results
*   A build log file: `tasks/results/task_013_slime_mold_build.log`
*   Successful compilation of the `ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation` crate.
*   The executable `ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation` should be present in `crates/introspector/crates/ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation/target/release/`.

## Verification
Review the `tasks/results/task_013_slime_mold_build.log` file for any errors or warnings. Ensure the executable is created.

## How to Submit
1.  Add the build log file to Git: `git add tasks/results/task_013_slime_mold_build.log`
2.  Commit the changes with a message like: `feat: Complete task_013_build_slime_mold_simulation - Slime mold build log`
3.  Update the status of this task in `tasks/task_013_build_slime_mold_simulation.md` to "Completed".
