# Task ID: task_017_formalize_bootstrap_lattice_mapping

## Description
Formalize the project's bootstrap process, enumerating and caching each step, and explicitly mapping these steps into the project's conceptual lattice structure. This task aims to create a verifiable and traceable bootstrap, ensuring its integrity and providing a foundation for formal verification of the entire system's genesis.

## Instructions (Conceptual Design & Implementation)

1.  **Enumerate Bootstrap Steps**:
    *   Identify and document every discrete step involved in the project's bootstrap process, from the simplest hex loader to the full operational system.
    *   This enumeration should be granular enough to allow for individual verification and caching.
    *   Consider the existing `rust-bootstrap` efforts and integrate their steps.

2.  **Define Bootstrap Step Caching Mechanism**:
    *   Design a system to cache the output or state of each bootstrap step. This could involve:
        *   Hashing the inputs and outputs of each step.
        *   Storing intermediate build artifacts.
        *   Using content-addressable storage.
    *   The goal is to ensure reproducibility and avoid redundant computations.

3.  **Map Bootstrap Steps to the Project Lattice**:
    *   **Lattice Elements**: Define how each enumerated bootstrap step, including individual opcodes, basic functions, syscalls, and standard library elements, corresponds to a specific location or element within the project's conceptual lattice. All versions of these granular elements will be mapped to their respective locations.
    *   **Partial Order**: Establish the partial order between bootstrap steps, reflecting their dependencies and sequence.
    *   **Properties**: Define properties or invariants that each bootstrap step must satisfy to be considered valid within the lattice (e.g., "step N produces a verifiable output based on step N-1's output").
    *   **Agreement and Version Convergence**: Explore mechanisms to ensure that all versions of these mapped elements (opcodes, functions, syscalls, stdlib) "meet in agreement" at their respective lattice locations. This implies a formal method for reconciling or demonstrating equivalence between different versions, ensuring a consistent and verifiable understanding across the project's evolution.

4.  **Integrate with Formal Verification Framework**:
    *   Explore how the formalized bootstrap and its lattice mapping can be integrated with the `task_010_formal_verification_build_supply_chain` and `task_016_lattice_based_formal_verification_project_state` frameworks.
    *   The goal is to formally verify the correctness and integrity of the entire bootstrap chain.

5.  **Documentation and Visualization**:
    *   Document the enumerated bootstrap steps, their caching mechanism, and their mapping to the lattice.
    *   Consider visualizing the bootstrap lattice to provide a clear overview of the project's genesis.

## Expected Output/Results
*   A detailed conceptual design document for formalizing the bootstrap and its lattice mapping.
*   An enumerated list of bootstrap steps.
*   A proposed caching mechanism for bootstrap steps.
*   A formal mapping of bootstrap steps to the project lattice.
*   (Optional) A small proof-of-concept demonstrating the enumeration and caching of a few bootstrap steps.

## Verification
*   Review the conceptual design for clarity, completeness, and alignment with the project's deep bootstrap and lattice vision.
*   Verify the accuracy of the enumerated bootstrap steps and their mapping.

## How to Submit
1.  Add any design documents or proof-of-concept code to Git.
2.  Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
3.  Update the status of this task in `tasks/task_017_formalize_bootstrap_lattice_mapping.md` to "Completed - Conceptual Design".
