# Task ID: task_014_blinkenlights_visualization_engine

## Description
Design and implement a "Blinkenlights Visualization Engine" capable of introspecting and visually representing the project's internal states and processes at various levels of detail and abstraction. This engine will serve as a dynamic, multi-scale introspector, providing insights into the project's "computational soul" from high-level overviews to granular details.

## Assigned To
[Unassigned]

## Status
Pending - Conceptual Design and Research

## Instructions (Conceptual Design & Research)

1.  **Define Visualization Levels & Details**:
    *   **High-Level**: What does the "blinkenlights" look like for the entire project? (e.g., overall health, activity, major component interactions).
    *   **Mid-Level**: How do individual modules or crates "blinken"? (e.g., function calls, data flow within a module, resource usage).
    *   **Low-Level/Granular**: How do specific functions or even individual lines of code "blinken"? (e.g., execution paths, variable changes, memory access patterns).
    *   Consider how the "slime mold" simulation (`ultimate_blinkenlights_simulation`) could serve as a foundational visual metaphor or a component of this engine.

2.  **Data Sources & Integration**:
    *   Identify potential data sources for the visualization (e.g., the project metamodel from `task_011`, telemetry data from `gemini` or `notel`, build logs, runtime traces, Git history).
    *   Design interfaces or APIs for integrating these diverse data sources into the visualization engine.

3.  **Visualization Techniques**:
    *   Explore various visualization techniques suitable for representing dynamic system states (e.g., heatmaps, flow diagrams, network graphs, custom animated graphics).
    *   Consider how to represent "activity," "health," "errors," or "progress" visually.
    *   Leverage the existing `ascii_slime_run` data as a starting point or inspiration for visual patterns.

4.  **Interactive Exploration**:
    *   Design user interfaces that allow developers to interact with the blinkenlights, zoom in/out, filter, and explore different levels of detail.
    *   Consider how this visualization can provide actionable insights for debugging, optimization, or understanding complex system behavior.

## Expected Output/Results
*   A detailed conceptual design document for the Blinkenlights Visualization Engine.
*   A proposed architecture for integrating data sources and rendering visualizations.
*   (Optional) A small proof-of-concept demonstrating a simple "blinkenlight" visualization based on a limited data set.

## Verification
*   Review the conceptual design for clarity, feasibility, and alignment with the vision of a multi-scale introspector.
*   (For proof-of-concept) Evaluate the effectiveness of the visualization in conveying insights.

## How to Submit
1.  Add any design documents or proof-of-concept code to Git.
2.  Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
3.  Update the status of this task in `tasks/task_014_blinkenlights_visualization_engine.md` to "Completed - Conceptual Design".
