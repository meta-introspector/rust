# Task ID: task_011_self_documenting_project_metamodel

## Description
Design and implement a self-documenting and self-evolving metamodel for the project. This metamodel will capture the project's architecture, components, dependencies, development processes, and historical evolution in a structured, machine-readable format. The goal is to provide a living, verifiable representation of the project's "computational soul" that can be used for automated analysis, documentation generation, and guiding future development.

## Assigned To
[Unassigned]

## Status
Pending - Conceptual Design

## Instructions (Conceptual Design & Research)

1.  **Define Metamodel Scope**:
    *   What aspects of the project should the metamodel capture? (e.g., file structure, module dependencies, function calls, data flows, task definitions, commit history, developer roles, design decisions).
    *   How granular should the metamodel be?

2.  **Choose Metamodel Representation**:
    *   Explore suitable formalisms for representing the metamodel (e.g., graph databases, ontologies, formal languages like OWL or Alloy, Lean4 data structures).
    *   Consider how to represent both static structure and dynamic evolution.

3.  **Automated Metamodel Extraction**:
    *   Develop tools or scripts to automatically extract information from the codebase, Git history, task definitions, and other project artifacts to populate the metamodel.
    *   This could involve static analysis of code, parsing commit messages, and analyzing task status changes.

4.  **Self-Evolution Mechanism**:
    *   Design a mechanism for the metamodel to automatically update and evolve as the project changes (e.g., new files, refactorings, task completions, new design decisions).
    *   Consider how to handle conflicts or inconsistencies during metamodel evolution.

5.  **Self-Documentation & Analysis**:
    *   Utilize the metamodel to automatically generate various forms of documentation (e.g., architectural diagrams, dependency graphs, project summaries, historical timelines).
    *   Develop tools to query and analyze the metamodel for insights into project health, complexity, and adherence to design principles.
    *   Explore how the metamodel could inform future development decisions or even suggest automated refactorings.

6.  **Verifiability & Gödel Number Integration**:
    *   Consider how the metamodel itself can be formally verified for consistency and accuracy.
    *   Explore how the metamodel could contribute to the project's "Gödel number" by providing a structured, verifiable representation of the project's state.

## Expected Output/Results
*   A detailed conceptual design document for the self-documenting project metamodel.
*   A proposed metamodel schema.
*   (Optional) A small proof-of-concept demonstrating automated extraction of a subset of metamodel data.
*   (Optional) A simple tool to query or visualize a portion of the metamodel.

## Verification
*   Review the conceptual design for comprehensiveness, feasibility, and alignment with project goals.
*   (For proof-of-concept) Verify the accuracy of extracted metamodel data.

## How to Submit
1.  Add any design documents or proof-of-concept code to Git.
2.  Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
3.  Update the status of this task in `tasks/task_011_self_documenting_project_metamodel.md` to "Completed - Conceptual Design".
