# Task ID: task_016_lattice_based_formal_verification_project_state

## Description
Develop a framework for lattice-based formal verification of project state transitions. This involves modeling project states (e.g., code, documentation, task statuses, plans) as elements in a mathematical lattice and formally verifying that transitions between these states (e.g., through commits, task completions, plan convergences) adhere to predefined properties, invariants, and move towards desired "fixed points" in the project's evolution.

## Instructions (Conceptual Design & Research)

1.  **Formalize Project States as Lattice Elements**:
    *   Define what constitutes a "project state" at various levels of abstraction, encompassing internal project components (e.g., a single commit, a completed task, a converged plan, the entire codebase) as well as external entities such as other Git repositories, independent projects, and even distributed ledgers like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) blockchains. Map these states to elements within a mathematical lattice structure.
    *   Map these states to elements within a mathematical lattice structure. Define the partial order relation (e.g., "state A precedes state B if B is a logical successor of A").
    *   Consider how the "metamodel" from `task_011` could serve as the underlying data structure for these lattice elements.

2.  **Define State Transition Rules**:
    *   Identify the operations that cause state transitions (e.g., `git commit`, `task completion`, `plan convergence`).
    *   Formally define the rules governing these transitions.

3.  **Specify Properties and Invariants**:
    *   Define properties that should hold true for all valid project states (invariants).
    *   Specify properties that should hold true for valid state transitions (e.g., "a task cannot move from 'Completed' to 'Pending'").
    *   Define "fixed points" in the lattice that represent desired stable states (e.g., a fully verified build, a converged plan).

4.  **Research Lattice-Based Formal Methods**:
    *   Explore existing formal methods and tools that operate on lattice structures (e.g., abstract interpretation, lattice theory in program analysis, model checking for state machines).
    *   Investigate how theorem provers like Lean4 can be used to define and reason about these lattice properties and transitions.

5.  **Verification of Transitions**:
    *   Develop a mechanism to formally verify that each project state transition (e.g., a new commit) adheres to the defined rules, properties, and invariants.
    *   This could involve analyzing Git diffs, metamodel changes, and task status updates.

## Expected Output/Results
*   A detailed conceptual design document for the lattice-based formal verification framework.
*   A formal definition of project states as lattice elements and state transition rules.
*   A set of formally specified properties and invariants for project evolution.
*   (Optional) A small proof-of-concept demonstrating the formal verification of a simple state transition.

## Verification
*   Review the conceptual design for mathematical rigor, feasibility, and alignment with the project's vision of a verifiable lattice.
*   (For proof-of-concept) Verify that the chosen tools can successfully prove the specified properties for state transitions.

## How to Submit
1.  Add any design documents or proof-of-concept code to Git.
2.  Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
3.  Update the status of this task in `tasks/task_016_lattice_based_formal_verification_project_state.md` to "Completed - Conceptual Design".
