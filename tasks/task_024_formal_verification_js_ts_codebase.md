# Task ID: task_024_formal_verification_js_ts_codebase

## Description
Develop a methodology and framework for formally verifying the validity, correctness, and security properties of the project's JavaScript and TypeScript codebase. This task aims to apply rigorous formal methods to ensure the trustworthiness of the frontend and any JS/TS-based backend components, complementing the formal verification efforts for Rust and other parts of the system.

## Instructions (Conceptual Design & Research)

1.  **Define Scope of Verification**:
    *   Identify critical JS/TS components for verification (e.g., core logic, security-sensitive parts, components interacting with external APIs or smart contracts).
    *   Define what "validity," "correctness," and "security properties" mean in the context of our JS/TS code.

2.  **Research Formal Methods for JS/TS**:
    *   Explore existing formal verification tools and techniques specifically designed for JavaScript and TypeScript (e.g., static analysis tools with formal underpinnings, model checkers, theorem provers that support JS/TS semantics).
    *   Investigate approaches like:
        *   **Type Systems**: Leveraging TypeScript's static typing for stronger guarantees.
        *   **Abstract Interpretation**: Analyzing program behavior without executing it.
        *   **Symbolic Execution**: Exploring different execution paths to find vulnerabilities or errors.
        *   **Model Checking**: Verifying properties against a finite model of the program.
        *   **Theorem Proving**: Using interactive theorem provers (like Lean4, if a suitable JS/TS embedding exists) to prove properties.
    *   Consider the challenges posed by JavaScript's dynamic nature, prototype-based inheritance, and asynchronous programming.

3.  **Integration with Inspection**:
    *   Define how manual code inspection will complement formal methods. Formal methods can prove the absence of certain bugs, but human inspection is crucial for understanding intent and identifying subtle design flaws.
    *   Develop guidelines for rigorous code reviews focused on formal properties.

4.  **Tooling & Workflow**:
    *   Identify or develop tools that can integrate into our existing development workflow (e.g., CI/CD pipelines).
    *   Consider how the results of JS/TS formal verification can be integrated into the project's metamodel (`task_011`) and contribute to the overall "GÃ¶del number."

5.  **Proof of Correctness**:
    *   For selected critical components, aim to produce formal proofs of their correctness or adherence to security properties.

## Expected Output/Results
*   A detailed conceptual design document for the formal verification of the JS/TS codebase.
*   A survey of available tools and techniques for JS/TS formal verification.
*   (Optional) A small proof-of-concept demonstrating the application of a formal method to a simple JS/TS function.

## Verification
*   Review the conceptual design for feasibility, rigor, and alignment with the project's trustworthiness goals.
*   (For proof-of-concept) Verify that the chosen method can effectively identify or prove properties in JS/TS code.

## How to Submit
1.  Add any design documents or proof-of-concept code to Git.
2.  Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
3.  Update the status of this task in `tasks/task_024_formal_verification_js_ts_codebase.md` to "Completed - Conceptual Design".
