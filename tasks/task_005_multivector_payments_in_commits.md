# Task ID: task_005_multivector_payments_in_commits

## Description
Design and implement a system to embed "multivectors of payments" within GPG-signed Git commits. This system aims to track and record various resource costs (e.g., time spent, memory usage, CPU cycles, cooling, water, coffee consumption) associated with development activities, enabling granular cost tracking and facilitating a tipping mechanism for contributions.

## Instructions (Conceptual Design & Research)

1.  **Conceptualize Git-Blockchain Hyperconnection & Commit as Vibe/Vector/Metameme**:
    *   Explore the analogy of a blockchain as an instance of a Git repository in a "hyper connection," where the structure of Git (commits, history) maps to the data structure of the blockchain.
    *   Consider each Git commit as a "vibe," "vector," or "metameme" that can be funded or not, based on its perceived value or impact.

2.  **Research Existing Solutions & Concepts**:
    *   Investigate existing methods for tracking development costs and resource consumption.
    *   Explore cryptographic methods for embedding data within GPG-signed commits without compromising commit integrity.
    *   Review the `goldpuppy/goldpuppy.github.io` project (now vendorized under `vendor/goldpuppy/goldpuppy.github.io`) for potential inspiration on cost tracking, resource allocation, or related concepts.

2.  **Define "Multivector of Payments" Schema**:
    *   Propose a structured schema for the "multivector" data. This schema should include fields for:
        *   Time spent (e.g., in minutes, hours)
        *   Memory consumed (e.g., MB-hours)
        *   CPU cycles (e.g., CPU-hours, joules)
        *   Cooling costs (e.g., kWh, water usage)
        *   Other consumables (e.g., coffee units)
        *   Associated monetary value (optional, but crucial for payments/tipping)
        *   Timestamp, commit hash, GPG signature details.
    *   Consider how these metrics can be automatically collected or estimated during development.

3.  **Integration with Git & GPG**:
    *   **Commit Header vs. File**: Decide whether to embed this data directly in the commit message/header or as a separate file within the commit. Embedding in the header might be more challenging due to size limitations and Git's internal structure. A dedicated file (e.g., `.payment_vector.json`) within the commit might be more flexible.
    *   **GPG Signing**: Ensure that the inclusion of this data does not invalidate or compromise the GPG signature of the commit. The data should be part of the signed content.

4.  **Cost Tracking & Tipping Mechanism**:
    *   **Data Aggregation**: Design a system to aggregate these payment vectors across multiple commits and contributors.
    *   **Reporting**: Develop tools to generate reports on resource consumption and associated costs.
    *   **Tipping Integration**: Explore how this data can be used to facilitate a tipping or micro-payment system for contributions, potentially integrating with cryptocurrency or other payment platforms.

## Expected Output/Results
*   A detailed conceptual design document outlining the schema for "multivectors of payments," proposed integration methods with Git/GPG, and a high-level design for cost tracking and tipping.
*   (Optional) A proof-of-concept script demonstrating how to embed and extract a simple payment vector from a GPG-signed commit.

## Verification
*   Review the conceptual design for feasibility, security, and alignment with project goals.
*   (For proof-of-concept) Verify that the embedded data can be correctly extracted and that the GPG signature remains valid.

## How to Submit
1.  Add any design documents or proof-of-concept code to Git.
2.  Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
3.  Update the status of this task in `tasks/task_005_multivector_payments_in_commits.md` to "Completed - Conceptual Design".
