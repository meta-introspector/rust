# Task ID: task_010_formal_verification_build_supply_chain

## Description
Develop a framework and methodology for the formal verification of the project's build process and its software supply chain. The goal is to ensure the integrity, reproducibility, and trustworthiness of every step from source code to executable, ultimately contributing to the construction of a verifiable "Gödel number" for the entire system state.

## Assigned To

## Status
Pending - Conceptual Design and Research

## Instructions (Conceptual Design & Research)

1.  **Define Scope of Verification**:
    *   Identify critical stages of the build process (e.g., compiler invocation, dependency resolution, linking, packaging).
    *   Define the boundaries of the "supply chain" (e.g., source code repositories, build tools, external libraries, operating system components).

2.  **Research Formal Verification Tools & Techniques**:
    *   Explore existing formal verification tools (e.g., Lean4, Coq, Isabelle/HOL) and their applicability to build systems.
    *   Investigate techniques for verifying properties of programs, compilers, and build scripts.
    *   Consider approaches like proof-carrying code, certified compilers, or verifiable builds.
    *   Tools like `diffoscope` (now vendorized under `vendor/reproducible-builds/diffoscope`) can be instrumental in verifying reproducible builds by highlighting differences between build outputs.

3.  **Model the Build Process**:
    *   Create a formal model of the project's build process, representing inputs, transformations, and outputs at each stage. This could involve using a domain-specific language or a general-purpose theorem prover.
    *   Define properties to be verified (e.g., "the executable produced is a correct compilation of the source code," "all dependencies are from trusted sources," "the build process is deterministic").

4.  **Supply Chain Integrity**:
    *   Develop methods to formally verify the origin and integrity of all components in the software supply chain. This could involve cryptographic hashes, digital signatures, and provenance tracking.
    *   Explore how to integrate with existing supply chain security standards (e.g., SLSA, SPDX).

5.  **Gödel Number Integration**:
    *   Conceptualize how the formal verification results and the entire verified system state could be encoded into a single, unique "Gödel number," representing a cryptographic fingerprint of the project's trustworthiness.

## Expected Output/Results
*   A detailed conceptual design document for the formal verification framework, including the scope, chosen tools/techniques, and modeling approach.
*   A formal model of a simplified build stage or supply chain component.
*   (Optional) A small proof-of-concept demonstrating the verification of a simple property within the build process.

## Verification
*   Review the conceptual design for rigor, feasibility, and alignment with the project's trustworthiness goals.
*   (For proof-of-concept) Verify that the chosen tools can successfully prove the specified properties.

## How to Submit
1.  Add any design documents or proof-of-concept code to Git.
2.  Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
3.  Update the status of this task in `tasks/task_010_formal_verification_build_supply_chain.md` to "Completed - Conceptual Design".
