# Task ID: task_023_eliza_social_media_integration

## Description
Integrate the `elizaos/eliza` framework into the project to leverage its multi-agent capabilities and built-in social media connectors. The primary goal is to utilize Eliza for automated interaction with various social media platforms, supporting both result distribution and social media campaign activities.

## Status
Pending - Conceptual Design and Integration Strategy

## Instructions (Conceptual Design & Integration Strategy)

1.  **Understand Eliza's Architecture & Connectors**:
    *   Review the `elizaos/eliza` codebase (now vendorized under `vendor/elizaos/eliza`), focusing on its `packages/` directory, particularly `plugin-bootstrap/` and how connectors for Discord, Telegram, etc., are implemented.
    *   Identify the specific connectors relevant to our social media campaign (`task_022`) and result distribution (`task_003`).

2.  **Integration Strategy**:
    *   **Standalone Eliza Instance**: Decide whether to run Eliza as a separate, dedicated service that our project interacts with via its API, or to integrate its core components directly into our Rust codebase (if feasible and aligned with our "deep bootstrap" philosophy). Given Eliza's Node.js/Bun dependency, running it as a separate service is likely the most practical initial approach.
    *   **API Interaction**: Design how our project will communicate with the running Eliza instance (e.g., via HTTP API calls to `http://localhost:3000/api`).

3.  **Social Media Connectivity Implementation**:
    *   **Result Distribution (`task_003`)**: 
        *   Develop modules within our project that format results (e.g., build logs, task summaries) into a structure Eliza can understand.
        *   Use Eliza's API to send these formatted results to target social media platforms (e.g., Discord channels, Twitter feeds).
    *   **Social Media Campaign (`task_022`)**: 
        *   Design automated interactions for the "color revolution" campaign (e.g., posting updates, responding to mentions, running polls).
        *   Utilize Eliza's agent capabilities to manage these interactions.

4.  **Agent Customization & Extension**:
    *   Explore how to customize Eliza agents to embody the project's "meta-memes" or "vibe."
    *   Investigate creating custom Eliza "actions" or "clients" to extend its functionality for our specific needs.

5.  **Security & Authentication**:
    *   Manage API keys and authentication tokens securely for both Eliza and the social media platforms.

## Expected Output/Results
*   A detailed conceptual design document for integrating Eliza with our project for social media connectivity.
*   A proposed architecture for communication between our project and Eliza.
*   (Optional) A small proof-of-concept demonstrating sending a message to a Discord channel via Eliza.

## Verification
*   Review the conceptual design for feasibility, security, and alignment with social media campaign goals.
*   (For proof-of-concept) Verify successful communication with a social media platform via Eliza.

## How to Submit
1.  Add any design documents or proof-of-concept code to Git.
2.  Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
3.  Update the status of this task in `tasks/task_023_eliza_social_media_integration.md` to "Completed - Conceptual Design".
