# Task ID: task_008_automated_task_status_updates

## Description
Implement a mechanism for the Gemini CLI agent to automatically update the status of tasks defined in `tasks/*.md` files. This will streamline the task management workflow, reduce manual overhead, and provide a more accurate real-time overview of project progress.

## Assigned To
[Unassigned]

## Status
Pending - Conceptual Design

## Instructions (Conceptual Design & Implementation)

1.  **Identify Trigger Points**:
    *   **"In Progress"**: When a user executes `scripts/run_task.sh` with a specific `task_id`. The script could signal me that the task has started.
    *   **"Completed"**: When a user commits results associated with a task (e.g., by analyzing commit messages for `feat: Complete task_<ID>`). This is more complex and might require a Git hook or post-commit analysis.
    *   **"Failed" / "Error"**: If a script execution fails or an error is reported during a task.

2.  **Develop Status Update Logic**:
    *   **Parsing Task Files**: Implement logic to read and parse the `Status` field within the Markdown task files.
    *   **Modifying Task Files**: Develop a safe and atomic way to update the `Status` field in the Markdown files. This should involve reading the file, modifying the specific line, and writing it back, ensuring no data corruption.

3.  **Integration with Existing Scripts**:
    *   **`run_task.sh` Modification**: Modify `scripts/run_task.sh` to notify me (or a dedicated status update function) when a task begins. This could be a simple `echo` to a specific log file that I monitor, or a direct tool call if a suitable tool is available.
    *   **Git Hook (Optional, Advanced)**: For "Completed" status, consider a client-side Git hook (e.g., `post-commit`) that analyzes the commit message and updates the task status if a specific pattern is matched. This is more complex to implement and manage.

4.  **User Feedback**: Provide clear feedback to the user when a task status is automatically updated.

## Expected Output/Results
*   A detailed conceptual design document for the automated task status update mechanism.
*   (Optional) A proof-of-concept implementation demonstrating automatic status updates for "In Progress" based on `run_task.sh` execution.

## Verification
*   Verify that task statuses are correctly updated in `tasks/*.md` files based on defined trigger points.
*   Ensure that the update process is robust and does not corrupt task files.

## How to Submit
1.  Add any design documents or proof-of-concept code to Git.
2.  Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
3.  Update the status of this task in `tasks/task_008_automated_task_status_updates.md` to "Completed - Conceptual Design".
