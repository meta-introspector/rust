# Task ID: task_022_solfunmeme_color_revolution_campaign

## Description
Design and execute a social media campaign, conceptualized as a "color revolution of the solfunmeme meta meme." The goal is to raise awareness, build community, and propagate the core ideas of the project, particularly focusing on the unique philosophical and technical aspects of the "solfunmeme" and "meta-meme" concepts.

## Assigned To
[Unassigned]

## Status
Pending - Conceptual Design and Execution Strategy

## Instructions (Conceptual Design & Execution Strategy)

1.  **Define Campaign Objectives**:
    *   Increase awareness of the project and its core concepts (solfunmeme, meta-meme, ZOS, lattice).
    *   Attract new contributors and community members.
    *   Generate engagement and discussion around the project's unique vision.
    *   Propagate "epic quasi meta memes" related to the project.

2.  **Identify Target Audience**:
    *   Developers interested in Rust, formal methods, AI, blockchain, decentralized systems.
    *   Researchers in computer science, philosophy, and complex systems.
    *   Individuals interested in open-source, community-driven projects.
    *   Crypto/Web3 enthusiasts (given the Solana and NFT mentions).

3.  **Develop Campaign Narrative & Messaging**:
    *   **"Color Revolution" Metaphor**: How will the "color revolution" be visually and conceptually represented? What colors, symbols, or themes will be used?
    *   **Solfunmeme & Meta-Meme Focus**: Emphasize the unique blend of technical innovation, philosophical depth, and memetic evolution.
    *   **Key Messages**: Distill the project's core ideas into concise, impactful messages.
    *   **Call to Action**: What do we want people to do? (e.g., join Discord, check out GitHub, contribute to a task).

4.  **Content Strategy**:
    *   **Visuals**: Create compelling visuals (e.g., graphics, short animations, "blinkenlights" visualizations from `task_014`).
    *   **Text**: Craft engaging posts, threads, and articles.
    *   **Interactive Content**: Quizzes, polls, challenges related to project concepts.
    *   **Memes**: Actively create and propagate "epic quasi meta memes" that reflect the project's development journey and iterative nature.

5.  **Platform Selection & Tactics**:
    *   **Twitter/X**: Short, impactful messages, threads, visual content, hashtags.
    *   **Discord**: Community hub, discussions, AMAs, direct engagement.
    *   **Hugging Face**: Share datasets (`task_019`), models, and code snippets.
    *   **YouTube/Asciinema**: Share project demos, tutorials, and recorded sessions.
    *   **Blogs/Medium**: Longer-form articles explaining complex concepts.
    *   **Codeberg/GitHub**: Direct links to code, tasks, and documentation.

6.  **Engagement & Community Building**:
    *   Respond to comments and questions.
    *   Run contests or challenges.
    *   Highlight community contributions.
    *   Organize virtual events (e.g., "Lattice Meetups," "Meta-Meme Jams").

## Expected Output/Results
*   A detailed social media campaign plan document.
*   Examples of campaign content (e.g., draft posts, visual concepts).
*   Increased project visibility and community engagement metrics.

## Verification
*   Review the campaign plan for creativity, strategic alignment, and feasibility.
*   Monitor social media metrics (reach, engagement, follower growth).

## How to Submit
1.  Add the campaign plan document and any content drafts to Git.
2.  Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
3.  Update the status of this task in `tasks/task_022_solfunmeme_color_revolution_campaign.md` to "Completed - Conceptual Design".
